            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Preſent your Lordſhip with a ſmall <hi>Compendium</hi> of many Great and Strange Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; The Greateſt, perhaps, that ever happen'd in <hi>England,</hi>

But when Princes themſelves ſuffer, 'tis the beſt Subjects Glory to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with them. This, My Lord, was no New thing to your Lordſhip, who was, in a manner, born a Sufferer for Monarchy, and whoſe Blooming Years had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſhare in the ſame Exile with your King. 'Tis ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fatal to conſider, that thoſe againſt whom the diſaffected

It ſeems, there needs no more than to read the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on backwards, and one may ſee by their falſe Clamours, who were the Kings beſt Miniſters and Friends. 'Twas the true Honour and Allegiance of that <hi>Auguſt Aſſembly</hi> in which your Lordſhip made one of the Better Part, that has Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized the Fame of <hi>Englands Baronage,</hi> and made it Glorious and beloved for ever. No

            <head>THE Preface.</head>
            <p>THere are ſome Scandals ſo Groſs, that the Bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of them is a ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, and manifeſtation of their Falſehood. In like manner ſome Actions are ſo unwarrantable to all men of Reaſon, that only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them is to diſgrace the Actors, and thoſe Principles that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd ſuch extravagant behaviour.
<pb facs="tcp:61366:5"/> Such I eſteem the factious Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Riotous Proceedings, which of late Years have diſturb'd the Quiet of ſo many honeſt Men and Loyal Subjects, to the Terror of this, and Amazement of all the Neighboring Nations.</p>
            <p>The Vehemency of which Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions did appear too like that of <hi>Naples</hi> in the Year 1647. 'Tis true, theſe were not ſo ſuddain, nor altogether ſo Bloody; which muſt be aſcribed to the Almighty Power and Goodneſs of God, and the Vigilant Prudence of His late Majeſty of glorious Memory. We ſee what the Party offer'd,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:61366:5"/>
            <p>Not to mention the Street-Tumults; How like were the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots at our <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> to thoſe at their Church of the <hi>Carmelites?</hi> And to their tumultuous burning the <hi>Gabellers Goods,</hi> I think I may, not unaptly, compair our burning the <hi>Pope,</hi> and other Burnings. And to parallel their <hi>Maſſaniello,</hi> a poor Fiſherman, but of ſtupendious Authority, had not we alſo, a little Creature of as Low and obſcure Quality (bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aſſumed Caſſok) who was as much adored, and I may ſay, almoſt Deifyed by the Rabble.</p>
            <p>I am heartily ſorry and aſham'd to think That the chief chief Diſparity
<pb facs="tcp:61366:6"/> between their Caſe and ours, will appear to the Diſadvantage of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For what the <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> did, they were induced to on the ſole Account of their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and Intolerable Gabells; but we a free and happy People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Seditious, and ſo very unquiet, for no preſent Cauſe, but only fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture apprehenſions, and (as the Event has ſhewed 'em to be) meer Chimaerical and empty Fears.</p>
            <p>But praiſed be God, Peoples Eyes begin to be open, and time has apply'd a <hi>Collyrium</hi> that makes us ſee cleerly through the Pretences and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrage that was raiſed to ſerve a Faction. It is
<pb facs="tcp:61366:6"/> eaſy now to diſtinguiſh the ſtalking horſe from the Fowler that ſculks behind. Which thing of late Years, many either cou'd not, or wou'd not ſee, being inwardly as Purblind, as he was outwardly that miſled 'em.</p>
            <p>And in this I think the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not a little obliged to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Author of the <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> A perſon who may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſome Pictures, that are placed too neer the ſight to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their true value. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the next Age, who will behold him at a more advantagious and impartial Diſtance, will have a truer and far greater eſteem of
<pb facs="tcp:61366:7"/> his Merits. I do not at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire (but think it extream na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural) that the Diſloyal Party and their Adherents do hate him with ſuch a perfect hatred. How could they Poſſibly do otherwiſe to one who diſcovers their Cheat, and puts 'em by from what they had been ſo long deſigning, when they were arrived almoſt to the very Day of Execution.</p>
            <p>The Subject of this little Book (moſt of which was Printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His late Majeſty fell ill) is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remember, in a ſhort Abſtract, what ſtrange and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Proceedings have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of Seven Years lately
<pb facs="tcp:61366:7"/> paſt, with what Heats they were tranſacted, how Truth and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty were run down with noiſe and Cant, and how People were ſcared out of their Wits with ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous <hi>Legends,</hi> that had not we who are now alive ſeen it with our Eyes, who would have believed it? Poſterity will ſcarce credit the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their Anceſtors; or if they do, they will bluſh to think an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> cou'd be ſo far impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon.</p>
            <p>The Memory of theſe things ought to keep People from Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſame Shelves and Sands, where formerly we were in Danger to have periſht.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:61366:8"/>
            <p>He that would give a Punctual and Particular Account of all the <hi>Narratives, Diſcoveries, Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, Executions, Speeches, Votes, Accuſations, Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Commitments, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Elections, Petitions, Ryots, Libells,</hi> and <hi>Seditious Attempts</hi> of all ſorts, during the ſaid time, muſt write a Hiſtory more Voluminous than <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Hollinſhead.</hi> I pretend not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to obſerve all particulars that happen'd in this ſpace of time, but, only thoſe which I thought moſt Material, and of greateſt Note.</p>
            <p>What I have related, was ſet down every thing at the time
<pb facs="tcp:61366:8"/> when it happen'd. Meer matter of Fact: without any Reflections, otherwiſe than as the thing it ſelf does reflect to the Diſhonour of that Faction which has occaſion'd all theſe paſt Troubles, and to the Glory of that God who has deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd us out of the Danger.</p>
            <p>I hope thoſe who have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and miſled by Specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, into ill Actions (as Charity bids me think there are many ſuch) will by reflection on the paſt, ſee, and abhor their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p>They need not bluſh to Repent and Confeſs ſuch faults, which ſome of Note and Quality have
<pb facs="tcp:61366:9"/> done already. Heaven is full of thoſe that have been Converts; But the Impenitent muſt fill another place, where it will be a Double <hi>Hell</hi> to remember that they might once have received Grace and pardon, but refuſed it.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF Hiſtorical Account Of the PUBLICK TRANSACTIONS During the 30th Year of the Reign of KING <hi>CHARLES</hi> II. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1678.</head>
            <p>I Deſign, in the Method obſerved by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſts, to commit to memory the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranſactions during the 30th Year of His Majeſty's Reign; a Year which ſeems remarkable, and to promiſe more than uſual, ſince that number hath been more than once ſignal in the courſe of His Royal Life. In the 30th Year of this Century (1630) He
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61366:10"/> was Born; the 30th day of <hi>May</hi> compleated the firſt day of His Age; on the 30th day of <hi>January</hi> He began His Reign; in the 30th Year of His Age (1660.) He was by the miraculous Providence of God, reſtored to the poſſeſſion of His Three Kingdoms af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and barbarous Exile.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this Year we find the Parliament ſitting; The King had newly made a Speech to both Houſes, the ſubſtance of which was; <q>That for their ſatisfaction he had made ſuch Alliances with <hi>Holland</hi> as are for the preſervation of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and which cannot fail of that end, unleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the want of due Aſſiſtances to ſupport thoſe Alliances, or by the ſmall regard the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves muſt have to their own Preſervation; That he cannot ſuſpect the want of aſſiſtance by reaſon of their repeated Engagements, that a War, which muſt be the neceſſary conſequence of thoſe Alliances, ought neither to be Proſecuted by halves, nor want ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of perſeverance as may give him encouragement to perſue it; that He had uſed all means poſſible by a Mediation to have procured an Honourable and ſafe Peace, knowing how preferable ſuch a Peace would have been to any War; that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61366:10"/> this Kingdom muſt neceſſarily own the vaſt benefits it has received by Peace, whilſt its Neighbours only have yet ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the War; but finding a Peace no longer to be hoped for by fair means, it ſhall not be his fault if it be not obtain'd by force; that for this reaſon he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd his Troops out of <hi>France,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd that we cannot have leſs Forces on our part than 90 Sail of Capital Ships, and 30 or 40 Thouſand Land-men, that he is contented that ſuch Monys as ſhall be given to theſe uſes, be appropriated as ſtrictly as they can deſire; that he hath directed ſuch larger dimenſions for the Building the New Ships as will coſt him above 100000 <hi>l.</hi> more than the Act allows; that for repairing the Old Fleet and buying Stores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He hath expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great deal more than 200000 <hi>l.</hi> He hath born the charge of a Rebellion in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and a New War with <hi>Algiers;</hi> that he ſtands engaged to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> for his Neices Portion; that he cannot be able to maintain his conſtant neceſſary Eſtabliſhments without the New Impoſition on Wines be continued; that to remove all ſorts of Jealouſies he hath Married his Neice to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61366:11"/> thereby giving full aſſurances never to ſuffer that Princes Intereſt to be ruin'd, if aſſiſted as he ought to be, to preſerve them; that he expects from them a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſupply ſuitable to ſuch great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and that theſe conſiderations being of the greateſt Importance that ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the Kingdom, he would therefore have them enter immediately upon them without ſuffering any other buſineſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to divert 'em.</q> Before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeded to Anſwer this Speech, they Sate on part of the 30th of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Aniverſary Faſt, and then Voted 70000 <hi>l.</hi> for a ſolemn Burial of his late Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and to erect a Monument for the ſaid Prince of Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Memory, the ſaid Sum to be rais'd by a Two Months Tax, to begin at the expiration of the preſent Tax for Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ships. This, tho' in truth, an Affair to which the Nation has ſtood obliged this 29 Years, yet being never mention'd till yeſterday, (when firſt moved in the Houſe of Commons by my Lord <hi>O-Brian</hi> Eldeſt Son to the Earl of <hi>Tumond,</hi> and whoſe Son lately had Marry'd my Lord Treaſurers Daughter) ſeem'd ſurprizing.</p>
            <p>The next Day being the 31 of <hi>January,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61366:11"/> the Houſe of Commons in return to the Kings Speech, preſented their Addreſs to His Majeſty at <hi>White-hall,</hi> containing thanks for his care expreſt for the preſervation and Encouragement of the Proteſtant Religon in concluding a Marriage between his Niece and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> beſeech him not to admit of any Treaty of Peace whereby the French King ſhall be left in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any greater Dominion or power than is left him by the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Treaty; that both on our parts and the parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, no Ship nor Veſſel may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come out of any Port of <hi>France,</hi> but that the Ships and Men be ſeized and the Goods deſtroy'd; that he would pleaſe to provide that none of the parties who ſhall joyn in this Alliance and Confederacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France,</hi> depart from the ſaid Alliance, till the ſaid King be reduced to the ſaid Treaty; that neither we nor the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates admit any Trade with <hi>France,</hi> or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Goods to be Imported from thence on pain of Forfeiture; that His Majeſty in making ſuch Confederacies as neceſſary for attaining theſe ends ſhall never doubt of the affections of the People: Laſtly they renew their former proteſtations and engagements to perſevere in the proſecution of the ſaid
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61366:12"/> War, and when he ſhall be pleas'd to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſuch Alliances and Confederacies to them in Parliament to give ſuch ready aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances upon all occaſions as may bring the War to a happy concluſion.</p>
            <p>To this Addreſs the King return'd the following Anſwer in Writing, which was read in the Houſe of Commons the 4th of <hi>February.</hi> 
               <q>That he was not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to find ſo much inſerted there of what ſhould not be, and ſo little of what ſhould; that his Speech was to both Houſes joyntly, and the return ought to be from both; That in the Addreſs of the 20th of <hi>May</hi> laſt you did invite him to a League offenſive and defenſive with <hi>Holland</hi> againſt the French King, and for the preſerving the Spaniſh <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and upon his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſuch Alliances aſſured ſuch ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy aſſiſtances as may fully Anſwer the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; that he hath made ſuch Alliances, yet finds no return but the Old promiſes upon new Conditions, and ſo He may be uſed to Eternity ſhould he ſeem ſatisfied with ſuch proceedings; that on the 28th of <hi>May</hi> laſt, he told you how highly he was offended at the great Invaſion of his Prerogative, yet you take no notice of it, but add to your former ill conduct new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61366:12"/> you deſire him to oblige his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates never to conſent to a Peace till the moſt Chriſtian King be reduced to the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaean</hi> Treaty, a Determination fitting only for God Almighty, ſince none but He can tell the terms of Peace who knows the event of War; You deſire him not to ſuffer a Ship of theirs to come from <hi>France</hi> under pain of Confiſcation, not excepting Allies, Prince, or Ambaſſadors (if any among them); that he does not believe any Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Men ever gave ſo great and publick a provocation to the whole World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as conſidering to provide one Ship, Regiment, or penny towards juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it; that however if by your aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he may be put into Armes ſufficient for ſuch a Work, He will not be weary till Chriſtendom be reſtored to ſuch a Peace, that it ſhall not be in the power of any one Prince to diſturb it; that the Rights of making and managing War and Peace are in His Majeſty, and if you think he will depart from any part of that Right, you are miſtaken; the Reins of Government are in his hands, and he hath the ſame care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them there, as to preſerve his own Perſon; he keeps both for his Peoples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and ſafety, and that if this Houſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61366:13"/> will encourage His Majeſty to go further in Alliances, you muſt conſider of raiſing ſpeedy ſupplies; for from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe he muſt take his meaſures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some things of note however were done before the Supply was concluded; The Houſe of Commons took off all written Protections, which had been by ſome Members granted to ſuch as were not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Servants, to an incredible number; Voting no Protection allowable to any but their Menial Servants, actually in Service, and that without a written Certificate.</p>
            <p>And now was the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd from his Confinement in the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he had been cloſe Priſoner ever ſince laſt Spring, and reſtored to his place in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, having firſt made the following Submiſſion at the Lords Bar, <hi>Feb. 25. viz.</hi>

               <hi>Monday</hi> the 29th of <hi>April</hi> the Houſes met again, the King and Lords in their Robes; My Lord Chancellor in a long Speech re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited all the Addreſſes that they had made in relation to a War with <hi>France,</hi> what the King had already done in purſuance of the ſame, and joyning an effectual League with the Confederates to that end, and how ready the King was to purſue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but that now he diſcovered the <hi>Dutch</hi> were entring upon a Treaty of Peace with the French King, and that without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or privity, and therefore His Majeſty demands the advice of his Houſes how to proceed.</p>

            <p>On the aforementioned <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 23. of <hi>May,</hi> the Parliament met again, and the Houſe of Commons being ſent for by the Black Rod, to attend His Majeſty, in the Houſe of Lords, the King delivered His pleaſure to this effect, <q>That he is reſolved, as far as He is able, to ſave <hi>Flanders,</hi> either by a War, or Peace, which way he ſees
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61366:16"/> moſt conducing; either ways, he thinks it convenient to keep up His Army, and Navy, at Sea, for ſome time, till a Peace be concluded, but leaves it to them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Supplies for their Continuance, or Disbanding; and in either caſe not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſo many Worthy and Gallant Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temen, who have offerd their Lives and Service to their Country, and that in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the Parliaments advice and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; That a Branch of His Revenue is now expiring, another part of it is cut off by a Clauſe in the Poll-Bill; That he has borrowed 200000 <hi>l.</hi> upon the Excize at their requeſt, of all which they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; That he hath no Intentions but of good to them, and His people, nor ever ſhall; Deſires they will not drive him into extremities, which muſt end ill, both for them and Him, and (which is worſt of all) for the Nation; deſires to prevent all diſorders and miſcheifs that may befal by our diſagreement; but in caſe any do, leaves it to God Almighty to Judge who is the occaſion of it; In fine, That he will not for the future ſuffer the Courſe and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of paſſing Laws to be changed, by taking together ſeveral matters in one Bill.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61366:17"/>
            <p>This was immediately followed by a long, but excellent Speech, of my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, which thô ſomething too large for the intended Brevity of theſe Notes, muſt not be omitted: The ſubſtance therefore contained, <q>That <hi>Holland</hi> is become reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſeek all occaſions they can of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the War, in regard the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> fail them; That the States to that end entred into a League Offenſive and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive with His Majeſty, to obtain a Peace by force, if it could not be had otherwiſe, which promiſed Succeſs, till it was heard abroad that this League, (the onely thing by which His Majeſty could oblige the States) had been ſo ill underſtood at home as to meet with ſome very unfitting and very undeſerved Reflexions; and that they underſtood there was a Reſolution of giving no Mony till ſatisfaction firſt had in matters of Religion, which in all Countrys are the longeſt debates that can be entred upon, and at this time ſhould leaſt have been ſtirr'd; &amp; when they underſtood that the King had received an Addreſs, and had expreſt His reſentment of it, then they concluded it was in vain to rely any longer on <hi>England,</hi> for <hi>England</hi> was no longer it ſelf: All ſides began to wiſh for Peace, as well <hi>Spain,</hi> as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61366:17"/> 
                  <hi>Holland,</hi> and if the Ceſſation now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, be effected, no doubt but a Peace will follow: What Influence that Peace will have, is uncertain; We have given no ſmall provocation to a Mighty King, it therfore concerns us to ſecure our ſelves, by preſerving Peace and Unity at home; he that foments Diviſions now, does more harm to his Country, than a Forrain Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my can do; no fear of Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can juſtify, no Zeal to Religion can ſanctify ſuch a Proceeding; He minds them of the Late times, when Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty were truly Loſt by being made a handle and pretence for Sedition; when Prelacy was calld Popery, and Monarchy Tyranny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and can we now endure to ſee men break the Act of Oblivion every day, by reviving the Memory of forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Crimes in new Practices? Its worth Conſideration whether we do not bring ſome kind of ſcandal upon the Proteſtant Religion, when we ſeem ſo far to diſtruſt the truth and power of it, that after ſo many Laws paſt to guard it, and ſo many miraculous deliverancies from the attempts made againſt it, we ſhould ſtill be affraid of its continuance. Hath not the Late Act made it impoſſible for the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61366:18"/> Papiſt that is, to get any kind of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment? As little reaſon there is to be jealous of our Liberties, and Property. Can there be a greater evidence of the Moderation of a Prince, and His tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Liberty of the Subject, than to ſuffer, as he does every day, ſo much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious and malitious Talk to paſs unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht? Search all Nations, through all Ages, and ſhew fewer greivances and leſs cauſe of Complaint, and a happier people than we at are this Day.</q> He proceeded then to the matter of the Revenue, to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with what the King had ſaid before, but enlarging, Tells em, <q>The King will no more accept a good Bill, how valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoever, unleſs it comes in the old and decent method of Parliaments; that the late way of tacking together, in one Bill, ſeveral Independent and incoherent matters, ſeems to alter the whole frame and Conſtitution of Parliaments; takes away the Kings Negative Voice in a manner, forcing Him to take all or none; it takes away the Negative Voice too, of the Houſe of Lords by the ſame Conſequence; It looks like a kind of Defamation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſeems to ſuppoſe the King, and Houſe of Lords, to be ſo ill affected
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61366:18"/> to the Publick, that a good Bill cannot carry it ſelf through, by the Strength of it's own Reaſon and Juſtice, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helped by Clauſes; it gives up the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhare of <hi>Legiſlature</hi> to the Commons: In fine, the ſame method of proceedings may be made uſe of againſt the Commons, by the Lords; Theſe Inconveniencies the King is Reſolved to aboliſh, and hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to ſay to you <hi>State ſuper vias antiquas.</hi> If this Seſſion do not repair the misfortunes, and amend the faults of the laſt, it will look like a fatality upon the Nation. He whoſe houſe is deſtroyed by Fire would find but little Comfort in ſaying the Fire did not begin by his means; but it will be a perpetual Anguiſh to him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it lay in his power to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it: And ſo concludes with ſtrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſives to Peace, and a Compoſure of all Differences.</q>

Reſolved in the Houſe of Commons, <q>That the Houſe taking into Conſideration the State of His Majeſties Affairs, and the great charge and Burthen that His Majeſty and the Nation lyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the Army now in Being, are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Opinion, That if His Majeſty pleaſe to think fit to enter into the War againſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61366:19"/> the French King, this Houſe is, and always will be ready to ſupport and aſſiſt him in that War; But if otherwiſe, That they will proceed to the Conſideration of providing for the Speedy Disbanding of the Army.</q> The Houſe further Ordered, That the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Houſe who are of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties privy Council, do acquaint the King with theſe Votes, and pray His Majeſties Anſwer.</p>
            <p>To this, the King returned the following Anſwer, which was read in the Houſe of Commons, the next day; It contained, <q>That the French King hath made ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of a Ceſſation till the 27th of <hi>July,</hi> as His Majeſty doth not only believe will be accepted, but will end in a General Peace; yet ſince that is not certain, he does not think it prudent to diſmiſs either Fleet, or Army before that time, nor doth he think it will add much to the charge, in regard the raiſing Mony, and paying them off, would take up that time, were they to be Disbanded as ſpeedily as poſſibly: In the mean time he deſires Mony for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that as hetherto they have been the moſt orderly Army that ever came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they may be encouraged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo; And concludes with reminding
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61366:19"/> the Houſe of the 200000 <hi>l.</hi> formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in His Speech, which he wants for His Houſhold.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next day of ſitting, being <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 30th of <hi>May,</hi> the Commons Vote unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, <q>That all Forces rais'd ſince the 29th of <hi>September</hi> laſt (except thoſe tranſported to Forrain Plantations) be forthwith paid off and Disbanded, and that they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of a Supply for that purpoſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt of <hi>May,</hi> being the firſt day of <hi>Trin. Term,</hi> Sir <hi>William Scroggs,</hi> at that time Puiſne Judge, in the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> took his place in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> as Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> to which he was preferr'd by the Kings eſpecial Favour, on the removal of Sir <hi>Richard Rainsford,</hi> who reſigned a few days before: And was Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Common-Pleas, by Baron <hi>Bartu;</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Brampſton</hi> promoted to his Place in the Exchequer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 4th the Commons Vote 200000 <hi>l.</hi> to be raiſed by a Monthly Tax, in Six Months, after the Land Tax, now in being, be expired; with a Clauſe, That this be for the Disbanding of the Army, by the end of this preſent <hi>June.</hi> The next day they Voted the King 200000 <hi>l.</hi> more, Towards the Defraying the expences of the Fleet.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61366:20"/> Soon after which, the King ſent them a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by one of the Secretaries of State, containing, <q>That His mind was ſtill the ſame with what he delivered the 23 of <hi>May</hi> laſt, That the Army, and Fleet, ought to be kept up till the expected Peace be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: He alſo recommended to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether it were not diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to recal His Forces in <hi>Flanders,</hi> from thoſe Towns which he had taken into His Protection, before they could provide themſelves of other Succours? Here upon they extend the time (as to the Forces in <hi>Flanders</hi>) to the 27 of <hi>July.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday,</hi> the 15th of <hi>June,</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Reſolved, That after <hi>Tueſday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no motions ſhould be made for any new Supplys of Money, till after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; nor any more private Bills brought, in, till after the ſaid Receſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, the King ſent for the Commons up to the Lords Houſe, and told 'em in a long Speech; <q>That the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon requiring a Receſs by the middle of next Month at fartheſt, it is convenient that we part fairly, and with a perfect confidence of one another: Therefore he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens His Heart freely to them in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61366:20"/> of neareſt concern; That what he told 'em at the beginning of this Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning a Peace, ſeems already to be determined, at leaſt as to <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> in which Peace His part will be not only that of a Mediator, but alſo to give His Warranty in it: That <hi>Spain</hi> writes word, that unleſs <hi>England</hi> bares the charge of maintaining <hi>Flanders,</hi> even after the Peace, they will not be in a Condition to ſupport it long; That to this end, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary not only to keep up our Navy at Sea, but to give the World ſome aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of being well United at home; That thô the Houſe of Commons may think ſuch a Peace as ill a bargain as War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will coſt them Mony; yet if they ſeriouſly conſider that otherwiſe <hi>Flanders</hi> had been loſt, perhaps by this time, He believes they will give much greater Summs than this will coſt, rather than the ſingle Town of <hi>Oſtend</hi> ſhould be in the <hi>French</hi> hands, and 40 of their men of War in ſo good a Haven overagainſt the Rivers Mouth; That we cannot but be pleaſed to underſtand the Reputation we have gained abroad by having in 40 days rais'd an Army of 30000 Men, and prepaired a Navy of 90 Ships; Therefore if they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61366:21"/> deſire to keep up the Honour of the Crown at home, and look to the ſafety of the Balance of Affairs abroad, and purſue the War of <hi>Algiers;</hi> if they deſire he ſhould paſs any part of His life in quiet, and all the reſt in confidence, and kindneſs with them and other ſuture Parliaments; if ſo, That they muſt find a way, not only to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for His life His Revenue as at Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs laſt, but alſo to add a new Fund of 300000 <hi>l. Per annum,</hi> upon which he will paſs an Act to ſettle 50000 <hi>l.</hi> upon the Navy and Ordinance; and ſhall be alſo always ready to conſent to all ſuch Laws as they ſhall propoſe for the good of the Nation: Then he reminds 'em to inable him to keep His word with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in the payment of His Neices Portion, which is 40000 <hi>l.</hi> the firſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being now due and demanded by him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Speech being ended, the Commons returned back and Voted His Majeſty the thanks of the Houſe for His gracious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in His Speech. Yet nothing of importance was done that day, but a Denial of the 300000 <hi>l. Per annum,</hi> demanded; and not only ſo, but a motion being made for a Compenſation on the loſt part of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtys
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61366:21"/> Revenue by the Prohibiting Act, it was carry'd in the Negative, <hi>Yeas</hi> 145, <hi>Noes</hi> 202.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22th of <hi>June,</hi> the Lords ſent down the Bill for Disbanding, with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the time prefixt for one Month longer, to which the Commons would not agree, but deſired a Conference, at which to give their Lordſhips the reaſons why they could not conſent to the alteration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 25th of <hi>July,</hi> the Parliament was Prorogued to the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the King having then paſt the following Bills, 1. An Act for granting a ſupply to His Majeſty of 619388 <hi>l. 11 s. 9 d.</hi> for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding the Army, and other uſes therein mentioned. 2. An Act for granting an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Duty to His Majeſty upon Wines for Three Years. 3.

An Act for Burying in Woollen. 5. An Act for Admeaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Keels and Boats carrying Coals. 6. An Act for Reviving a former Act of the 13th of this King ch. 2. for avoiding unneceſſary Suits and delays, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of an other Act of 22. &amp; 23. <hi>Car'</hi> 2. ch. 10. touching inteſtates Eſtates,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61366:22"/> 7. An Act for further Relief and Diſcharge of poor Priſoners for Debt. 8. An Act touching Highways. 9. An Act for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Fiſhing in the River <hi>Severn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On which ſaid firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> they being again met, they were again Prorogued over to the 29th Day of the ſame Month. Soon after that alſo there came out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, requiring a full Aſſembly at the ſaid 29th Day. But in the mean time the French being beaten from the Siege of <hi>Mons,</hi> by the Engliſh, chiefly, under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of my Lord of <hi>Oſſery,</hi> on the part of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the King Iſſued out another Proclamation dated the 8th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> whereby reciting the laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation but in regard the State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs abroad was alter'd ſince then, he is pleas'd to Prorogue the Houſes over till the firſt Day of <hi>October</hi> next, requiring then a full Aſſembly; after this it was again Prorogued to the 21ſt of <hi>October.</hi> In the mean time a Peace is concluded between <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and a Truce for ſome Months with the Emperor.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday, Sunday, Monday</hi> and <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the 28th 29th and 30th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> and firſt of <hi>October,</hi> the Privy-Council ſate twice a Day, The buſineſs a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61366:22"/> Popiſh Plot; ſeveral were committed, and others examin'd, among whom Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> Phyſician to the Queen, and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> belonging to Her Royal Highneſs the Dutcheſs of <hi>York:</hi> which ſaid Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs went with the Lady <hi>Ann,</hi> that very <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning to viſit the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> deſigning a ſtay only of 14 Days. This Diſcovery of a Plot, opening every Day more and more, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> were committed cloſe Priſoners, with ſeveral others; their Studies ſearch'd, their Papers ſeized, and ſent to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> And now juſt before the meeting of the Parliament, one Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> a ſevere Enemy of the Papiſts (as by ſome report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) was found Dead in a Ditch not far from <hi>Hampſtead;</hi> He appear'd to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners Jury to be ſtrangled, tho' after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own Sword was run through him, and ſo found, with Money in his Pocket. This was lookt on by the Town as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the above-mention'd Plot.</p>
            <p>On the appointed 21ſt of <hi>October,</hi> the Houſes met: The Kings Speech contain'd theſe words, and theſe words only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Plot—<q>I have been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61366:23"/> of a Deſign againſt my Perſon by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, of which I ſhall forbear any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, leſt I may ſeem to ſay too much, or too little, but leave the matter to the Law—</q> The Chancellor on the ſame Head had theſe Expreſſions.—<q>And tho' His Majeſty doth in no ſort prejudg the Perſons accuſed, yet the ſtrict enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into this matter, hath been a means to Diſcover ſo many other unwarrantable Practices of theirs, that His Majeſty hath reaſon to look to 'em.</q> The Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Plot and the concurrent Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> employ'd the Commons ſo aſſiduouſly, that towards the beginning of this Seſſion they ſate whole Days, from Morning till late at Night. The Product was a Faſt Voted; the minutes and Votes of the Houſe of Commons forbid to be divulg'd; ſeveral Lords Committed, <hi>Bellaſis, Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder, Powis, Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Petre, Caſtlemain,</hi> &amp;c. Soon after this came out a Proclamation, appointing a Faſt through all <hi>England,</hi> on the 13th Day of <hi>November. Thurſday</hi> the 31ſt of <hi>October,</hi> the Houſe of Commons reſolved, upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that hath already appear'd to this Houſe, this Houſe is of Opinion, <q>That there hath been and is an Execrable and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61366:23"/> Deſign contrived and carry'd on by Popiſh Recuſants for Aſſaſſinating and Murthering the King, for Subverting the Government, and for deſtroying the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion by Law Eſtabliſht.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Day Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was Buried. The Solemnity proceeded from <hi>Bridewell</hi> to St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields, 72 <hi>London</hi> Miniſters Marching two and two before the Body, and above 1000 Men in the ſame Order following after.</p>
            <p>The next Day in purſuance of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs preſented to the King by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons the <hi>Saturday</hi> before, came out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, whereby all Papiſts, or ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, be Baniſht 10 Miles from <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to remove themſelves by the 7th Day of <hi>November,</hi> except Houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and they to take the Oaths or ſuffer the Penalties inflicted by Law. The ſame Day the Commons in Parliament reſolved, That an Addreſs be made to the King, that the Trained-Bands of <hi>London, Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> be rais'd for preſervation of His Majeſtys Perſon, and the Parliament, during this Seſſion.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the 4th of <hi>November,</hi> came out an Order of the King in Council, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, That whoever can Diſcover any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61366:24"/> or Soldier in any of the Kings Guards, Horſe or Foot, who has taken the Oaths and Teſt, and ſince turn'd Papiſt, ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer ſhall have 20 <hi>l.</hi> for every Man ſo Diſcovered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 4th of <hi>November,</hi> It was moved in the Houſe of Commons, that an Addreſs be made to the King, to remove the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from his Preſence and Councils; but the debate was Adjourn'd over to <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> next, at which time it being again mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the debate was again Adjorn'd over to <hi>Thurſday</hi> following. The next Day being <hi>Saturday</hi> the 9th of <hi>November,</hi> His Majeſty went to the Lords Houſe in His Robes, and made a Speech to both Houſes, Wherein after he had return'd them His moſt hearty Thanks for their very great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary care for preſervation of His Perſon in this time of Danger, <q>He told 'em, That he was as ready to joyn with them in all ways and means that may Eſtabliſh a firm ſecurity to the Proteſtant Religion, as their own Hearts can wiſh; and this not only during His Life, but in future Ages even to the end of the World: And therefore He is come to aſſure 'em, that whatſoever reaſonable Bills they ſhall preſent to be paſt into Laws to make them ſafe in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61366:24"/> Reign of His Succeſſor, ſo as they intend not to Impeach the Right of Succeſſion, nor the Diſcent of the Crown in the true Line, and alſo as they reſtrain not any Power or juſt Right of His Proteſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, ſuch Bills ſhall find from him a ready concurrence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this came out another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, whereby all Roman Recuſants, and ſuch reputed, were enjoyn'd under the Penalty of the Laws to repair to their own homes, and not to remove more than Five Miles from thence without Licence; Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of this Proclamation the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday,</hi> the 18th of <hi>November;</hi> the Houſe of Commons being informed that Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> Secretary of State, had lately Counterſigned ſeveral Commiſſions for Roman Recuſant Officers with a <hi>Non-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante</hi> to the Oaths and Teſt, he was by the ſaid Houſe Committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi> The next Day the King ſent for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to attend him at the Banquetting-Houſe, and told 'em, <q>That tho' they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted His Servant without acquainting him, yet He intends to be freer with them, and acquaint them with His intentions,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61366:25"/> to releaſe His Secretary;</q> which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly He did that Day.</p>
            <p>About this time a Bill having been ſent up from the Commons to the Lords Houſe, for Excluding all Popiſh Members to ſit in either Houſe of Parliament, it was paſt in the ſaid Lords Houſe with ſome little alterations, and a Clauſe in Favour of His Royal Highneſs; and the ſaid Bill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent back to the Commons, it paſt there alſo <hi>November</hi> 21ſt, with the ſaid altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but not without ſome difficulty; for Sir <hi>Jonathan Trelauny</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Aſh,</hi> being heated in debate and words of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach paſſing between 'em, Sir <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſtruck the other a cuff on the Ear, which being return'd by <hi>Aſh,</hi> over the Face, they were both about to Draw, but this diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance being at laſt quieted by the Speaker, <hi>Trelauny</hi> was ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> there to remain all this Seſſions, and <hi>Aſh</hi> received a <hi>Reprimande</hi> from the Speaker.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time came out an Order of Council, explaining the late Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby all Papiſts were Baniſht 10 Miles from <hi>London,</hi> not to extend to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſtrangers, and ſuch Outlandiſh, who repair hither on the account of Travail.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61366:25"/>
            <p>And now the Commons begin to look towards the Army again, reſolving <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 25. That it is neceſſary for the ſafety of His Majeſty's Perſon, and Preſervation of the Government, that the Forces raiſed ſince the 29th of <hi>November</hi> 77. be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with paid off and Disbanded; and for this the King requires more Mony.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Oats</hi> (the great Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer of the Plot) accuſes the Queen; hereupon the King places a ſtricter Guard upon him than ever; but the Commons, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 29. order an Addreſs to be made to His Majeſty, That the ſaid <hi>Oats</hi> be freed from his reſtraint, attended by his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and that a competent allowance be appointed for his maintenance; and that the Queen, with all her Servants, and all Popiſh Recuſants, or ſuch ſuſpected, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saturday, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 30. the King had two Bills preſented to him; one of which, <hi>viz</hi> For Excluſion of all Popiſh Members to fit in either Houſe of Parliament (with a Clauſe in favour of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>) He paſt: The other, which was for raiſing a third part of the Militia, to be in conſtant Arms for a time, He refuſed; alledging, That that were to put the Militia out of his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61366:26"/>
               <q>Power, which thing He would not do, no not for one hour; but if the Parliament will aſſiſt Him with Money for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, He will take care to raiſe ſuch a part of the Militia as ſhall ſecure the Peace of the Government, and His own Perſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, while theſe things are tranſacting in Parliament, one <hi>William Staly,</hi> a Goldſmiths Son, a <hi>Roman Recuſant,</hi> is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar, found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and condemned of High Treaſon, for ſpeaking certain words againſt the Kings Life, and accordingly was hanged and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at <hi>Tyburn;</hi> but on Petition the King granted his Quarters to his Father; who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the Kings mercy, buried him in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden</hi> Church-yard with too much State and Ceremony; for which reaſon, by His Majeſties Order, his Quarters were that very night taken up, conveyed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and ſoon after ſet up on the Gates of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The ſame week that <hi>Staly</hi> was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was arraigned and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the aforeſaid Bar, and condemned of High Treaſon; The Evidence was the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Oats,</hi> and one <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and his own Letters; but both the aforeſaid Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als being in Print, I ſhall take no farther notice of particulars. The King gave back
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61366:26"/> all Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Eſtate to his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and his Quarters to be Buried.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, December</hi> the 17th, <hi>Ireland, Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering,</hi> and <hi>Groves,</hi> were Condemned of High Treaſon as Conſpirators in the Plot, but their Execution was reſpited for ſome time.

            <p>In the mean time the Parliament ſit inceſſantly; without Adjournment theſe Hollidays, but only for <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-Eve and <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Day: requiring a full ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of all their Members, not diſabled, as well Lords as Commons; enjoyning all in Town not to depart under ſtrict penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſending their Meſſengers for all abſent in the Country.</p>
            <p>But it pleas'd the King on <hi>Monday</hi> the 30th of <hi>December</hi> to Prorogue both Houſes till the 4th of <hi>February</hi> following. Not long before which the Commons had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more Mony for the Disbanding the Army, but inſerted a Clauſe in the Bill, for the Mony to be paid into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>London;</hi> which proviſo would not paſs in the Lords Houſe, and therefore the Bill remain'd abort. During this Interval the Reports were various touching the next ſitting: it being ſometimes affirmed that the Seſſion was further Prorogued till the 25th of <hi>February,</hi> then again, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would certainly meet at the 4th
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61366:27"/> of <hi>February,</hi> the Day firſt appointed; till at laſt on the 24th Day of <hi>January,</hi> the King was pleas'd to ſettle the variety of Rumour, and by His Proclamation, then publiſht, abſolutely to Diſſolve this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, promiſing however to Iſſue out His Writs for a New one by the 6th of <hi>March</hi> next following. Thus ended this Parliament, having now been continued by ſeveral Prorogations and Adjournments 17 Years, Eight Months, and 17 Days, being firſt called on the Eighth Day of <hi>May, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Domini,</hi> 1661.</p>
            <p>With this great Turn I will conclude my Hiſtorical Obſervations on this 30th Year of His Majeſtys Reign; a Year very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable if it were only on the account of the Diſſolution of this Parliament; but more eſpecially for the beginning of thoſe Troubles and Combuſtions which laſted for ſo many Years after, in Relation to the Plot.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And now the Parliament, which had been called according to the Kings promiſe on the Diſſolution of the laſt, meet at the appointed 6th day of <hi>March.</hi> The Kings Speech contained, <q>That in order to the uniting the minds of His Subjects both to Himſelf and to one another, He had exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Popiſh Lords from their Seats in Parliament; Cauſed the Execution of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral men both for the Plot and Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey;</hi> Disbanded as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61366:29"/> much of the Army as he could get Mony to do; Above all, That He hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Brother to abſent himſelf; That ſo all colour may be taken from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious men of pretending any influence of Popiſh Councils: That He propoſes by this means to ſee whether the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion and the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be as truly aimed at by others, as they are really intended by Him; if ſo, they (the Members of Parliament) will lay aſide all private animoſities, and employ their time upon the great Concerns of the Nation; That he will not ceaſe to make further ſearch into the Plot and the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Sir <hi>Edmunbury Godfrey,</hi> for which he deſires the aſſiſtance of both Houſes; That he has ordered the Penal Laws to be Executed againſt Papiſts; Deſires their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in raiſing Supplys for Disbanding the Army and paying off the Fleet; and that they would ſome way make up the loſs He has ſuſtain'd by the Prohibition of <hi>French</hi> Wines and Brandy, which turns only to His prejudice, and the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>French;</hi> That it is neceſſary to have a Fleet at Sea, ſince our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are making Naval Preparations;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61366:30"/>That a Conſtant eſtabliſhment might be made for the Navy; And concludes with His earneſt deſires to have this a healing Parliament; Aſſuring them to defend with his life the Proteſtant Religion and the Laws of the Kingdom, and expects to be by them defended from the Calumny as well as Danger of thoſe worſt of Men, who endeaver to render both him and His Government odious to His People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Chancellors Speech was chiefly a deſcant on the former heads; <q>Reminding the Two Houſes as<note place="margin">p. 12.</note> to the Plot, not to over do their Buſineſs, and that by being too far Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the fears of Popery, they do not neglect the opportunities of making ſober and laſting Proviſions againſt it; which (ſays he) are the only hopes of the Papiſts, thus to ſee<note place="margin">p. 14.</note> our Zeal out-run our Diſcretion, and that we our ſelves ſhould become the unhappy occaſion of making our own Councils abortive.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King and Lord Chancellor having ended their Speeches, the Commons return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their own Houſe, and unanimouſly choſe for their Speaker, Mr <hi>Seymour,</hi> who had officiated in that Place in the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61366:30"/> who being the next Day preſented to the King, was refuſed; and the Houſe Ordered to proceed to a new Election; which notwithſtanding was not made till <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15th of <hi>March,</hi> on which day they choſe Mr Serjeant <hi>Gregory,</hi> the ſaid choice being on the <hi>Monday</hi> following ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>After this the Commons draw up an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the King for a Faſt, in which alſo the Lords Concur; and a Faſt was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Proclamation dated <hi>Mar.</hi> 28, to be obſerved throughout the Nation on the 11th of <hi>April</hi> following.</p>
            <p>A Committee being appointed to enquire into the manner of ſuing out the Earl of <hi>Danby's</hi> Pardon, which upon ſearch being not entred in any Office from the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries Office until it came to the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, but diſpatch'd in a private manner, and ſo reported by the Committee, the Houſe of Commons reſolve <hi>Mar.</hi> 24. That an humble Addreſs be made to His Majeſty, repreſenting the irregularity and illegality of the Pardon mentioned to be granted to the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and the Dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of Granting Pardons to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that lye under an Impeachment of the Commons of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>They alſo deſire of the Lords, that the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> may be ſequeſtred from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and put into ſafe Cuſtody; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Lords Order the Uſher of the Black Rod to take him; but upon ſearch at his Houſes both in Town, and at <hi>Wimbleton,</hi> he could not be found; hereupon a Bill is Ordered to be brought in, that <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> render himſelf to Juſtice by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day, or in default thereof to be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, which Bill was read twice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. In the mean time the Lords had paſt a Bill in their Houſe for baniſhing and diſabling the ſaid Earl, which being ſent down to the Commons for their Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, was by them rejected, as a Cenſure too favourable. They alſo Vote an Addreſs to be made to His Majeſty, That the ſaid Earl be not permitted to reſide in any of His Majeſties Houſes of <hi>Whitehall, Somerſet-houſe,</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi>'s. Alſo another Addreſs for a Proclamation to apprehend the ſaid Earl, and that no Subject preſume to harbour or conceal him. In the mean time the Bill of Attainder againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> was highly canvaſt at ſeveral Conferences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lords and Commons, till at laſt on the 16th of <hi>April,</hi> a Meſſage is brought from the Lords Houſe, to acquaint the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61366:31"/> That the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> had the laſt night rendred himſelf to the Uſher of the Black Rod, and is committed by their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the ſame 16th of <hi>April,</hi> 4 of the 5 popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> who had been on the 9th inſtant Impeacht, gave in their Anſwers in Perſon, viz. <hi>Powis, Stafford, Petre,</hi> and <hi>Arundel;</hi> but the Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> being diſabled by the Gout, had his Anſwer received in Writing.</p>
            <p>On the 20th of <hi>April,</hi> the King was pleas'd to declare to His Privy Council His pleaſure to diſſolve them, and to conſtitute a new one, which for the future ſhould conſiſt of the conſtant number of 30 Members, of which 15 to be certain, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> 2. Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> 3. Lord Chancellor. 4. One of the Chief Juſtices. 5. The Admiral. 6. Maſter of the Ordenance. 7. Treaſurer. 8. Chancellor of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> 9. Privy Seal. 10. Maſter of the Horſe. 11. Lord Steward. 12. Lord Chamberlain of the Houſhold. 13. Groom of the Stole. And the two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries. The other 15 elective at the Kings pleaſure, 10 out of the Nobility, and 5 Commoners. Beſides theſe, ſuch Princes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61366:32"/> of the Blood as ſhall be at Court; A Lord Preſident, and a Secretary of <hi>Stotland,</hi> but theſe uncertain. And according to this new Model, ſo many of them as were in Court did the next morning, being <hi>April</hi> 21, meet in the Council Chamber, and were there Sworn Privy-Counſellors. The ſame day His Majeſty was pleaſed to acquaint the two Houſes with what he had done, and that He was reſolved in all His weighty and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affairs, next to His great Council in Parliament, to be adviſed by this Privy Council.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 24th day of <hi>April, Nathaniel Reading,</hi> Eſquire, was Tryed before my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North,</hi> and ſeveral other ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Court at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi> His crime of which he ſtood indicted was for endeavoring to ſtifle <hi>Bedlo's</hi> Evidence againſt the Popiſh Lords, or at leaſt to leſſen the ſame; which being proved by the Oaths of the ſaid <hi>Bedloe,</hi> one <hi>Wiggins</hi> his Man, and one Mr <hi>Speke,</hi> which two laſt <hi>Bedloe</hi> had hid privately in his Chamber to over-hear their diſcourſe; he was found guilty; had Judgment to ſtand in the Pillory for an hour in the <hi>Palace-Yard,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:61366:32"/> Impriſonment for one year, and fined 1000 <hi>l.</hi> Which Sentence was accordingly Executed.</p>
            <p>About this time it was that the Biſhops of <hi>Ely, Glouceſter,</hi> and <hi>Bath and Wells,</hi> were accuſed for Papiſts, but the Accuſation quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell, it being diſcovered to be a malicious contrivance to blaſt their Reputation, and fix a Scandal on the whole Order.</p>
            <p>On the 25th of <hi>April</hi> the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> appear'd in Perſon at the Bar of the Lords Houſe; the Earl putting in his Plea, and the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The next day the Lords <hi>Stafford, Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Powis,</hi> appear'd at the ſame Bar, and having retracted their former Pleas to their Impeachments (which appeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to the Houſe of Commons) put in their further Anſwers to the ſame.</p>
            <p>After this, on the laſt day of <hi>April</hi> His Majeſty was pleaſed to ſend for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to attend Him in the Houſe of Lords, and acquaint 'em by the mouth of the Lord Chancellor, <q>That he was ready to agree to any Laws to ſecure Religion, ſo the Diſcent of the Crown in the Right Line be not defeated, and therefore he is willing that a Proviſion be made, Firſt to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a Papiſt from a Proteſtant Succeſſor,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61366:33"/> then to limit the Authority of the Firſt in theſe particulars, <hi>viz</hi> that all Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment may be confer'd on Pious and Learned Proteſtants; That there may not want a Parliament on the Kings Death, but that the Parliament then in being, or the laſt that ſat, ſhould at ſuch time reaſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without any new Summons or Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That during the Reign of any Popiſh Succeſſor, no Privy Counſeller, no Judge at the Common Law, or in Chancery, ſhall be put in, or diſplaced but by Authority of Parliament; That none but Proteſtants be Juſtices of Peace; ſo alſo for Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, Deputy Leiutenants and Officers in the Navy, not to be put in or removed but by Authority of Parliament; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that it is hard to invent any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to be put on a Popiſh Succeſſor; yet if any thing elſe can occur to the Wiſdom of the Parliament whereby to ſecure Religion, and Liberty, without defeating the Right of Succeſſion it ſelf, that His Majeſty is moſt ready to conſent to it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After the Conſideration of this Speech had been Adjourn'd over from time to time; <q>It was at laſt Reſolved on the 11th of <hi>May</hi> in the Houſe of Commons in defence
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61366:33"/> of the Kings Perſon and the Proteſtant Religion, that they will ſtand by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with their Lives and Fortunes; and that if His Majeſty ſhould come by any violent Death (which God forbid) that they will revenge it to the utmoſt upon the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </q> And according to this Vote they drew up an Addreſs on the 14th, with this varation in the form of Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>We ſhall be ready to Revenge upon the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> any violence offered [by them] to your Sacred Majeſty.</q> The Words, by them, being neither expreſt nor intimated in their Vote, though eſſential and neceſſary to the Juſtice of the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Revenge.</p>
            <p>Further then this they took no notice of the Kings Reſolution expreſt in the ſaid Speech; but contrary to that Clauſe which related to the Succeſſion, on the 15th of <hi>May,</hi> they brought in a Bill to Diſable the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to Inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which being Read the firſt time on the ſaid 15th of <hi>May,</hi> was on the 21ſt read again and Committed to a Committee of the whole Houſe; yet the Houſe divided on the Queſtion. <hi>Yeas 207. Noes</hi> 123. But the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61366:34"/> ſoon after Prorogued, it never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament are very earneſt in debating the Methods relating to the Tryals of the five Popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Danby;</hi> which laſt being on the third of <hi>May</hi> demanded, at the Bar of the Lords Houſe, whether he would rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and abide by the Plea of his Pardon, return'd for Anſwer, That being adviſed by his Council that his Pardon is good in Law, he doth inſiſt upon his Plea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that his Council may be heard: With which their Lordſhips acquainting the Commons, they Order a return to be made to their Lordſhips by the whole Houſe in theſe words, on the 5th of <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My Lords, the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes in Parliament Aſſembled, are come up to demand Judgment in their own Names and the Names of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> againſt <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> who ſtands Impeacht by them before your Lordſhips of High Treaſon, and divers high Crimes and Miſdemeanors, To which he has pleaded a Pardon, which Pardon the Commons conceive to be illegal and void, and therefore they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61366:34"/> do demand Judgment of your Lordſhips accordingly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the 6th of <hi>May</hi> it was ordered in the Houſe of Lords, that <hi>Saturday</hi> next be appointed for the Earl of <hi>Danby's</hi> Plea to be argued, and that the five Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> be tryed this Day Sennight: With which Orders they acquainted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons the next Day, and that their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips had appointed an Addreſs to be made to His Majeſty to appoint a Lord Steward for the ſaid Tryals. The Commons not well ſatisfied with theſe proceedings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that a Committee of both Houſes may be nominated to conſider of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ways and methods of Proceeding upon Impeachments, according to the uſage of Parliament. But the Lords refuſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the Propoſal as inconformable to the Rules and Orders of proceedings of their Houſe, which is and ever muſt be tender in matters relating to their Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Upon this Anſwer the Commons reſolve (<hi>May</hi> 9.) That no Commoner whatſoever preſume to maintain the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Pardon pleaded by the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> without the leave of this Houſe firſt had; and that the Perſons ſo doing ſhall be accounted Betrayers of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61366:35"/> of the Commons of <hi>England.</hi> After this it ſeems that the Lords did recede from their former reſolution, for on the 11th of <hi>May,</hi> they acquainted the Commons by Meſſage, That they had appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee conſiſting of Twelve Lords, to joyn with a Committee of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to conſider of propoſitions and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in relation to the foreſaid Tryals.</p>
            <p>Which joint Committee of both Houſes meeting, they diſ-agreed about the Biſhops being preſent at the Tryals. for the Lords having reſolved in their Houſe, That the Lords Spiritual have a right to ſtay in Court in Capital Caſes till the Court proceed to the Vote of Guilty or Not Guilty: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Commons reſolved on the other ſide to inſiſt upon it, that the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ought not to have any Vote in any Proceedings upon Impeachments againſt the Lords in the <hi>Tower.</hi> The two Houſes ſeeming to diſſer on this point, the Biſhops thought to find out a <hi>Medium,</hi> and on the 16th of <hi>May,</hi> deſired leave of the Houſe of Lords that they might withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Tryals of the ſaid Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lords, with the Liberty of entring their uſual Proteſtations.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:61366:35"/>
            <p>But this did not ſatisfie the Houſe of Commons, who on the 24th of <hi>May</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that they cannot proceed to the Tryal of the Five Lords before Judgment be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Pardon, and in the point of the Biſhops Voting in Capital Offences. For which they drew up Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the 26th of <hi>May</hi> delivered the ſame to the Lords at a Conference: which being very large, and in print, I ſhall here omit.</p>
            <p>And in this poſture did the Publick Tranſactions in Parliament appear on the 27th day of <hi>May,</hi> at which time it pleas'd His Majeſty to Prorogue both Houſes until the 14th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> next.</p>
            <p>About this time the King was pleaſed to remove Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> from being Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and confer the Place on Captain <hi>Cheek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Troubles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which broke out in this Month, gave occaſion of much diſcourſe, and no little alarm in <hi>England.</hi> They begun in the Barbarous Murder of Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> on the 3d of <hi>May,</hi> as he was travelling from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to his own Reſidency; The Murderers were a company of <hi>Inveterate Covenanters,</hi> who, in regard the ſaid Biſhop
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61366:36"/> had been formerly one of their Party, and now revolted (as they called his honeſt Reformation) bore him a moſt immortal hatred, having attempted his Life ſeveral times before. But the Aſſaſſins ſtop not at Murder, for ſoon after this they gather into a Body in the Weſtern parts of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and fall into open Rebellion and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; on the 29th, a Party of the Rebels well mounted and armed, came to <hi>Rugland,</hi> proclaim the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and burnt the following Acts of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>The Act concerning the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</q> The Reciſſory Act (by which all the Mock-Laws, made in the times of the late Anarchy, were repeal'd.) <q>The Act for eſtabliſhing Epiſcopacy: And the Act appointing the Anniverſary of the 29th of <hi>May</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61366:36"/> he did in one Battle; killing ſome, and taking ſeveral Hundreds of Priſoners; of which ſome few being hang'd, eſpecially thoſe who were more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Arch-Biſhops Murder, the reſt were Tranſported.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>London.</hi> On the 13th of <hi>June, Thomas White,</hi> alias <hi>Whitebread.</hi> Provincial of the Jeſuits in <hi>England, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Harcourt, John Fenwick, John Gaven,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Turner,</hi> all Jeſuits, were Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and found Guilty of High Treaſon as Conſpirators in the late Plot; The next Day <hi>Richard Langhorn</hi> Eſq; a Bariſter of the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi> was Tryed at the ſame Bar for the ſame Crime, and being alſo found Guilty, all ſix had Sentence of Condemnation, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Executed; the five Jeſuits on <hi>Fryday</hi> the 20th of <hi>June,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> on the 14th of <hi>July</hi> following; All departing this Life with the greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of Innocence, as to the Crimes Objected, as could be poſſibly expected.</p>
            <p>On the laſt Day of <hi>Trinity-Term,</hi> being the 9th of <hi>July,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Dean,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Pepys</hi> Eſq; two Members of the preſent Parliament were on a long debate let to Bail in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:61366:37"/> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Principals in a Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> a piece, and every one of the Bail 5000 <hi>l.</hi> They had been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Tower,</hi> by Order of the Houſe of Commons on the 20th of <hi>May</hi> laſt; their Accuſation Treaſon, Piracy, and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony on the Stat. 31. <hi>El.</hi> 4. And being on the firſt Day of this Term removed by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus</hi> into this Court, the ſaid Crimes were here charged againſt 'em in ſeveral Affidavits by <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Moon;</hi> but it ſeems the Evidence not appearing ſo home as expected, they were now Bail'd, and ſo continued till the laſt Day of <hi>Hillary-Term</hi> following, at which time they were Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged on their own ſingle Recognizance to appear in <hi>Trinity-Term</hi> next without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to any Tryal.</p>
            <p>But now arrives the 10th of <hi>July,</hi> on which Day the King was pleas'd to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the preſent Parliament by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a Declaration of His Intention to call another on the 17th of <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>On the 18th of <hi>July</hi> Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> Baronet, the Queens Phyſitian, <hi>William Marſhal, William Rumley,</hi> and <hi>James Corker,</hi> Benedictin Monks, were Tryed for High Treaſon relating to the late Plot; the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61366:37"/> Evidence, <hi>Oates, Bedloe,</hi> and others; But the Jury found 'em not Guilty, and they were diſcharged. Several Libels hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on flew abroad againſt my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> who notwithſtanding did ſufficiently acquit himſelf from all aſperſion in the Judgment of ſober People.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the King fell dangerouſly ill at <hi>Windſor,</hi> upon the Intelligence of which His Royal Highneſs came over Poſt to His Majeſty; But it pleas'd God that the King recovering His Health, to the great Joy of the Nation; The Lord Mayor of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with the Court of Aldermen, and a Train of 30 Coaches, and about 100 Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, went on <hi>Monday</hi> the 15th of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> to <hi>Windſor</hi> to Congratulate His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Recovery, which Complement was as kindly received as handſomely performed. On the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following the King, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by His Royal Highneſs and the whole Court, rerurn'd to <hi>Whitehall;</hi> that Night by the Lord Mayors expreſs Order there were Bonfires throughout the whole City for His Majeſty's return, as well to His former Health, as place of Reſidency. But it ſeems the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving contracted the Kings Diſpleaſure, on ſome account or other, not commonly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61366:38"/> known, His Majeſty was pleas'd to take from him his Commiſſion of Captain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and for a time expel him the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſoon after this the ſaid Duke went over to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and at the ſame time His Royal Highneſs return'd to <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> But this laſt, it ſeems, without deſigns of any long ſtay there, for on <hi>Sunday</hi> Night the 12th of <hi>October,</hi> His ſaid Royal Highneſs, the Dutcheſs, and Family, arrived at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, to the ſurprize of ſome, and Joy of others.</p>
            <p>The King having call'd a New Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menz, as he had formerly promiſed on the Diſſolution of the laſt, to meet on the 17th of <hi>October,</hi> He was now further pleas'd to Prorogue it from the time appointed, to the 26th of <hi>January</hi> following.</p>
            <p>On the firſt Day of <hi>Michaelmas-Term,</hi> my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> took occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make an Excellent Speech in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Court, concerning the many Scandalous Libels that had been Publiſht againſt him ſince Sir <hi>George Wakemans</hi> Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and acquittal; in which Speech he purged himſelf at large of any Corruption and with a great meaſure of Courage declar'd, <q>That he was neither afraid nor aſhamed to own what he had done; That
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61366:38"/> the Impeachment of the courſe of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Juſtice by vulgar noiſe and clamour did not at all terrify him to a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Rabble, againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Underſtanding, nor to try a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſe otherwiſe then according to the Evidence and the probability and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility it carries with it.</q> Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Dolbin</hi> ſpoke alſo to the ſame purpoſe, and appear'd as Compurgators of the Chief Juſtices Integrity.</p>
            <p>Much diſcourſe there was at this time, and many Narratives came out daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Diſcovery of a New Plot which the Papiſts (was is ſaid) had contrived to lay on the Presbyterians. The chief Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer was one <hi>Dangerfield</hi> alias <hi>Willoughby;</hi> Several were accuſed, and laid up as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators; among whom, the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> Mrs <hi>Celier,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Payton,</hi> and Mr <hi>Gadbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Effigies of the Pope in all his <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificalibus,</hi> had been for ſeveral years paſt ſolemnly burnt by the people, in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> yearly; but never with ſo much Ceremony, as on the 17th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> this year, it being a Day obſerved by ſome in memory of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The Proceſſion conſiſted of one perſonating the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61366:39"/> Dead Body of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on a Horſe, with a Bell-man to mind the People of his Murther, Prieſts in Copes with a large Silver Croſs, Carmelite, and Gray Friers, ſix Jeſuites, and after them the Waits, ſeveral Biſhops, ſome in Lawn Sleeves, others with Copes and Miters on, then ſix Cardinals, and after them the Pope on a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant with Boys and Incenſe Pots, and other Ceremonious Pomp, behind him the Devils Repreſentative; In this manner they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about five at night from <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi> to the <hi>Temple-gate</hi> at <hi>Chancery Lane</hi> End, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Thouſands of People, at which appointed ſtation, they Committed the Effigies to the Flames of a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Bonfire, at which time the mock-Devil departed, and the Shew ended.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 27th of <hi>November,</hi> The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> arrived in the night time at <hi>London,</hi> on whoſe return the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens expreſt a mighty Joy by Bonfiers, Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and Ringing of Bells all the next day and moſt part of the night.</p>
            <p>In the mean time his Royal Highneſs with his Ducheſs and Daughter, attended with a Guard and Retinue ſuitable to their Quality, made a Journey into <hi>Scotland:</hi> Where being arrived, The Duke was at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61366:39"/> on the 4th of <hi>December,</hi> received and Complemented by the Privy Council of that Kingdom, with abundance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Honor; The Lord Chancellor made a Speech in the name of all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to which his Royal Highneſs Anſwer'd in very affectionate Terms, expreſſing his great ſatisfaction at the Civilities he had received ſince his arrival in that Kingdom: And declaring his readineſs to promote the Honor and Service of the King, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>About this time great endeavors were uſed to procure a Multitude of Hands to Petitions which were framing in <hi>London, Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſeveral Counties, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King for the ſitting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament on the 26th day of <hi>January</hi> next according to the laſt Prorogation; which manner of Petitioning being unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and tumultuous, the King was pleaſed, in Council <hi>Dec.</hi> 10. to Order the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen to take care in their ſeveral ſtations of His Majeſties Honor, and of the peace and ſafety of the City, and not to ſuffer ſuch perſons that ſhould ſign ſuch Petitions, or go about to procure hands to them to go unpuniſhed; but that they ſhould proceed againſt them or cauſe them
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61366:40"/> to be brought before the Council Board to be puniſhed, according to a Reſolution of all the Judges of <hi>England, 2. Jac.</hi> (which may be ſeen. <hi>Cro.</hi> 2. part of Reports, <hi>fol.</hi> 37.) His Majeſty was further pleaſed to iſſue out His Proclamation dated the 12th day of <hi>December,</hi> containing, <q>That whereas he hath been informed that divers evil diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons endeavor in ſeveral parts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to frame Petitions to His Majeſty for ſpecious Ends and purpoſes relating to the publick, and thereupon to collect and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to the ſame the hands and ſubſcriptions of multitudes of His Majeſties Subjects; which Proceedings being contrary to the Common and known Laws of this Land, and tending to promote diſcontents among the People, and to raiſe Sedition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, His Majeſty doth therefore ſtrictly charge and commad all and every his lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects of what Rank or Degree ſoever, that they preſume not to agitate or promote any ſuch Subſcriptions, nor in any ways joyn in any Petition of that manner to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to His Majeſty, upon peril of the utmoſt rigour of the Law that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for the ſame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time His Majeſty iſſued out another Proclamation, declaring His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61366:40"/> to Prorogue the Parliament from the 26th of <hi>January</hi> to the 11th of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> next.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the ſcope of theſe two Proclamations, the buſineſs of Petitioning went forwards; ſeveral were perfected and delivered not long after, one from <hi>London</hi> Subſcribed with many Thouſands of hands, others from, <hi>York, Eſſex, Surrey,</hi> and <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> all which the King receiv'd but coldly, and as appeared afterwards, ineffectually, for on the 26th of <hi>January</hi> being the Day to which the Parliament was Prorogued, His Majeſty was pleaſed to make a ſhort Speech to both Houſes, containing, <q>That when he declared in Council His Intention of putting off the Parliament to a time ſo remote as <hi>November,</hi> it was not without mature Conſideration; That he cannot be perſwaded from any thing that has happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince (in reference to Affairs within the Kingdom) to alter or repent of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; That notwithſtanding, conſidering the preſent danger which threatens ſome of our Neighbours and Allies, He thinks fit to appoint a day for their meeting again in <hi>April;</hi> yet the Diſtractions and Jealouſes at home are of ſuch a nature, and ſo height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and improved by the malice and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61366:41"/> and Induſtry of ill men, that he is unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablyloſ opinion that a longer Interval of Parliament will be abſolutely neceſſary for compoſing and quieting of Mens minds; in order to which, he is afraid the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies would prove ineffectual without the aſſiſtance of ſome further time; He reſolves therefore that on the ſaid meeting in <hi>April</hi> there ſhall be a further Prorogation, unleſs the Condition of our Allies abroad do then require our imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate aſſiſtance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon he commanded the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to Prorogue the Parliament to the 15th of <hi>April.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time Articles of high Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor were offer'd by way of Complaint to the King and Council againſt the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> by <hi>Oates,</hi> and <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe,</hi> who had formerly declar'd themſelves unwilling to give any Evidence againſt any Papiſts, or concerning the late Popiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy in any Court where the ſaid Chief Juſtice ſhould fit as Judge. But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this Affair ſoon fell, and the Cauſe never came to be heard, further than the Chief Juſtices Anſwer.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gaſcoigne,</hi> a <hi>York-ſhire</hi> Knight of 85 years
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61366:41"/> of age, was Arraigned at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> upon an Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of High Treaſon in conſpiring the Death of the King, and the Subverſion of the Government. He was afterwards brought to his Tryal at the ſame Bar; the Jury were all <hi>York-ſhire</hi> Gentlemen, the Foreman, Sir <hi>Thomas Hodſon;</hi> The chief Evidence againſt him one <hi>Balron,</hi> who had formerly been Baily of his Colepits, and one <hi>Mowbray,</hi> who had alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his Family; but their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it ſeems, not being of that Weight or credibility with the Jury as ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, they brought in their Verdict Not Guilty; whereupon the Priſoner was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſcharged.</p>
            <p>We are now arrived at the end of the 31ſt year of His Majeſties Reign, a year obſervable for many Revolutions, thô all concluding peaceably and well, through the Mercy of God, and the Wiſdom of our Superiours, the factious Rabble having been never more ready for Combuſtion, ſince the late Wars of Curſed Memory.</p>

            <p>THE Concluſion of the laſt Year left his Royal Highneſs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the beginning of this muſt be remarkable for his return to <hi>England;</hi> which healing Action in the entrance, will, I hope, as a good Omen, prognoſticate Peace and Happineſs to the King and Kingdom, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reſt of this Thirty ſecond Year of His Majeſty's Reign.</p>
            <p>On the 31 of <hi>January,</hi> the Duke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Lords of the Privy Council at <hi>Edinburg,</hi> 
               <q>That he had received a Letter from the King, calling him very ſpeedily to Court; That though he did very chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obey His Majeſty's Commands, and went with much joy to attend Him, yet he could not part from their Lordſhips ſo ſoon without a great deal of Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61366:42"/> and Trouble, having both at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and during the ſhort time of his abode there, met with all poſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of civility and kindneſs, both from the Nobility, Gentry, and from the Repreſentatives of the ſeveral Bodies of the Nation, particularly from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, of which he had ſo juſt a reſentment, that he could not in all his life forget them, and ſhould not fail upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to meet their great kindneſs and affection ſhewn him, with all the ſervice he was capable to do them; That he would acquaint His Majeſty that He had in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a brave and loyal Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, a regular Privy Council, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures filled with able Perſons well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to His Majeſty's Service and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; That he had obſerved the diſaffected Party were nothing ſo conſiderable as their Friends in <hi>England</hi> ſtudied induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to repreſent them to be. He then recommended to the Council the ſetling of the Differences between ſeveral Gentlemen of the <hi>Highlands,</hi> whom he had always obſerved to be firm to His Majeſty's Intereſt.</q> The Lord Chancellor, in the name of the Council, acknowledged the great happineſs they had had in hi
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61366:43"/> Preſence, Conduct, and Advice, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how much devoted they all were to the Service of His Majeſty and his Royal Highneſs; and that they could not expreſs the great grief they had to part ſo ſoon with him, to whoſe Council and Preſence they owe ſo many Advantages.</p>
            <p>After this the Duke, Ducheſs, and all their Retinue, began their Voyage by Sea for <hi>London,</hi> where he arrived at the Court Privy Stairs on the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> about Three in the afternoon, not without all the due ſigns of Joy and Welcome. There ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the ſame time from the Privy Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Letter full of Loyal Expreſſions to the Kings Service, with abundance of Recommendation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations for the Duke's Intereſt. Two days after his arrival, his Royal Highneſs was attended by the Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen, Recorder, and Common Council of the City of <hi>London;</hi> at which time the Recorder having in all their names Congratulated his ſafe arrival, they all kiſt the Hands both of the Duke and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs.</p>
            <p>On the 11th of <hi>February,</hi> His Majeſty was pleaſed to declare in Council, that He had granted His Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> leave
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61366:43"/> to reſign his Place of Secretary of State; That His intention was to continue him however of His Council; And that He had made choice of Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> to ſucceed him in the Place of Secretary, who was accordingly Sworn of His Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil that day, and took his place at the Board.</p>
            <p>Before the end of this <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, the Court of <hi>Kings Bench</hi> produced ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſages relating to the publick. For beſides the Tryal and Acquittal of Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoin</hi> (of which before) on the 9th of <hi>February, Thomas Whitfield, John Smallbones,</hi> and <hi>William Laud,</hi> having been formerly indicted for a Ryot, in tearing a Petition which was ſome time ſince carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about to get Subſcriptions to it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſitting of the Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now tryed for the ſame at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar, they were found Not guilty of the Ryot, and onely Mr. <hi>Whitfield</hi> guilty of tearing the Petition; but what offence that action did amount to, was not at that time declared by the Court.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time ſeveral Bookſellers were puniſht for publiſhing Seditious and Scandalous Libels; but above all, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt <hi>Benjamin Harris,</hi> the Publiſher

            </p>
            <p>On the fifth of <hi>March</hi> His Majeſty was pleas'd to iſſue out His Proclamation againſt <hi>Highway-men,</hi> promiſing thereby the Summ of 10 <hi>l.</hi> to any one who ſhould diſcover any ſuch, from the date of the ſaid Proclamation until the ſecond of <hi>March</hi> following, which ſaid Summ was appointed to he paid imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on the Conviction of ſuch Robber, by the Sherif of the County; and to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd on His Accounts.</p>
            <p>On the ninth of <hi>March</hi> the King iſſued out another Proclamation againſt ſuch, who <q>under a vain pretence of Honor, take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to be the Revengers of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Quarrels in Duels and ſingle Combat, which ought not to be upon any pretence or provocation whatſoever, ſtrictly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and commanding all his loving Subjects

            <p>On the 15th of <hi>April,</hi> being the day to which the Parliament was formerly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued, the King then abſent at <hi>Newmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> my Lord Chancellor, by Commiſſion under the Great Seal, Prorogued it further to the 17th of <hi>May</hi> following, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being preſent in the Houſe. On the 17th of <hi>May</hi> it was further Prorogued till the firſt of <hi>July.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now it was that thoſe Counties which had been lately ſo active in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Petitions for the ſitting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, began to be aſhamed of ſuch Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to recant. The City of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> was the firſt, whoſe Grand Jury by their publick and formal Act, at their Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> diſown'd the ſaid Action of promoting Petitions, and charged it on certain Factious perſons unknown to them; this, and more to this purpoſe, they deſired their Steward, Mr. <hi>Withens</hi> of the <hi>Middle Temple,</hi> to repreſent in their names to His Majeſty, which he did ſoon after, and was Knighted for his Loyalty by the Name of Sir <hi>Francis Withens.</hi> After this followed the like Addreſſes from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Surry, Eſſex, Middleſex,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:61366:45"/> which laſt mentioned County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> had this further Acknowledgment in their Meſſage, <hi>viz. Their humble thanks to His Majeſty for recalling the Duke from</hi> Flanders. To the ſame purpoſe, ought not to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what happened in my Lord <hi>Shandois</hi> his Caſe, who having been elected by the <hi>Turkey</hi> Company of Merchants to go Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and deſiring His Majeſty's Approbation, the King was pleas'd to reply, <q>That he having countenanced and been engaged in the Buſineſs of a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the Parliament (which His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty lookt upon as derogatory to His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and tending to Sedition) He could not think him fit for this Favour.</q> Hereupon the ſaid Lord deſiring to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the Council of Foreign Affairs at <hi>Whitehall, Apr.</hi> 26. did there humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to His Majeſty his fault in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been concerned in the ſaid Petition, alledging, That he was miſled and drawn in, by being given to underſtand that that proceeding was for His Majeſty's Service; but that being ſince better informed, he abhorred and diſowned all ſuch Practices, and humbly begg'd His Majeſty's Pardon for what was paſt. After which the King was pleas'd to receive him into His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61366:46"/> and confirm his Election to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie.</p>
            <p>About this time it was, that a falſe and dangerous Rumour flew abroad, and was ſpread about the Town, concerning a <hi>Black Box</hi> reported to be found, wherein was ſaid to be contain'd a Writing importing a Marriage or Contract between His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Mother; which report coming to the King's Ear, He was pleas'd to Summon the Council to meet extraordinarily on the 26th of <hi>April,</hi> in which He declared the ſaid report to be altogether falſe, and that He thought Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged in Honor and Conſcience to have the matter throughly examined and ſearched into; In order whereunto Sir <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Gerard</hi> (who was rumour'd to have ſeen ſome ſuch Writing) being called in, was examined in Council (his Royal Highneſs, and all the Judges of the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> being preſent) touching the truth of what was reported; To which he anſwered upon Oath, <q>That he never had any ſuch Writing committed to his Cuſtody, nor did he know of any ſuch thing, or had ever ſeen ſuch Writing.</q> To all which he alſo ſubſcribed his Name. His Majeſty declaring He reſolved to uſe all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61366:46"/> means poſſibly to find out the Author of this Report. And accordingly a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Council did ſit for a great while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to ſift into the Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>On the fifth of <hi>May,</hi> all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> having been demanded their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, made their Report in Council, and declared for Law, <q>That His Majeſty may Prohibit the Printing and Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all News-Books and Pamphlets of News whatſoever not Licenſed by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Authority, as manifeſtly tending to the Breach of the Peace, and Diſturbance of the Kingdom:</q> And accordingly the King iſſued out His Proclamation to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs 'em, <hi>May</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>On the 11th of <hi>May,</hi> being about the middle of <hi>Eaſter Term,</hi> a Bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of High Treaſon againſt the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> was deliver'd to the Grand Jury of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> who not being ſatisfy'd with the ſufficiency of the Evidence, after a long Examination, brought the Bill in, <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtorm of Hail that fell at <hi>London</hi> on the 18th of <hi>May</hi> about eleven of the Clock in the morning, is not to be paſt without Obſervation; which though it came not very thick, nor continu'd long, yet
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61366:47"/> was of ſuch note, that ſome were meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above ſix Inches about; I ſaw many fall bigger than Pigeons Eggs, or ordinary Walnuts, none leſs than ones finger end, and hard as Stones, till they had lain a while. Several Rooks in the <hi>Temple Garden</hi> were beaten down from the Trees and killed with this Hail, as ſo many Shot or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</p>
            <p>On Wedneſday the 19th of <hi>May, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Taſburgh</hi> of <hi>Flixton</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk</hi> Eſq; was Tryed at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar upon an Indictment of High Treaſon in Conſpiring the Death of the King, but upon a long Evidence to little purpoſe, was found Not Guilty (the Jury never going from the Bar) and diſcharg'd.</p>
            <p>On Friday the 21 of <hi>May</hi> was brought to the ſame Bar, by <hi>Habeas Corpus, William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> who much complaining of his long Impriſonment, was informed by the Court, <q>That all the Judges had reſolved upon mature Conſideration, that he being Impeacht of Treaſon in Parliament, he could not be tryed out of Parliament; and for the ſame reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, it was out of the Power of this Court to Bail him; That he, and the other Lords in the Tower were not within the benefit
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61366:47"/> of the late Act touching <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>'s; That the Court was ſorry they could not relieve him; and that there was no way for him to come to his Tryal but by the ſitting of the Parliament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The day following Sir <hi>Henry Tichburne,</hi> the elder <hi>Roper,</hi> and <hi>John Caryl</hi> Eſq; were Bail'd at the ſame Bar, though accuſed of High Treaſon; yet in regard there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but one Witneſs againſt them (<hi>viz. Oats</hi>) they were diſcharged of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, upon Bail.</p>
            <p>On the laſt day of the Term, the Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Payton,</hi> and one <hi>Beding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> were abſolutely diſcharg'd of all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. The ſame day a Bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of High Treaſon was found and brought in by the Grand Jury of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> againſt the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Nine and twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> being the ſolemn Anniverſary for the Kings Birth and Reſtoration, paſt this year with the uſual Church Service, and the Joy of Bells, but without any Bonfires at night, all Bonfires, not only on this, but any other day whatſoever, having been forbid (by order of the Privy Council, <hi>April</hi> 7.) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Licence firſt obtain'd from the Council or other Magiſtrates: Such Bonfires as of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61366:48"/> late, having been obſerved the occaſions of tumult and dangerous opportunities of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: This day was alſo obſerved at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> with great ſolemnity and triumph, Fifty old Men (the Number of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Age) attending the Ceremony, each having a Largeſs of 50 s. The King and the Dukes Healths were publickly drank at the <hi>Market Croſs,</hi> the Conduits running Claret, and abundance of Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Lemons, and Sweatmeats thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p>About the 10th of <hi>June</hi> arrived ill News from <hi>Tangier,</hi> the <hi>Moors</hi> on the 14th paſt ſo ſtraitned <hi>Charles</hi> Fort with their Siege, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gariſon, being but 180 Men, under Captain <hi>Trelawney,</hi> reſolved to quit it as deſperate, and fight through the Enemy, to the Town of <hi>Tangier;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they laid a Mine to blow it up after their departure, and paſſing through the Enemies Works in the night (which Paſſage they found more difficult than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) the whole Army of the <hi>Moors</hi> were alarmed and came in upon them, kill'd neer 150, cut the Captain all to pieces, about 38 men eſcaping through. <hi>Henrietta</hi> Fort being alſo at the ſame time loſt to the Enemy.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61366:48"/>
            <p>On the the firſt day of <hi>Trinity Term,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Celier</hi> was tryed for High Treaſon, at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar, the Indictment run in the uſual form as againſt the reſt of the Plotters; but the chief, (and indeed only) Evidence againſt her, <hi>Thomas Dangerfield,</hi> being proved by Records then produced, ſo great and infamous a Criminal, his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony was refuſed by the Court to be admitted, and chiefly in regard he ſtood Outlaw'd of Felony, and Felony not being expreſt in his Pardon, ſhe was therefore found Not Guilty; and <hi>Dangerfield</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf committed to cuſtody, till he could find Bail to Reverſe the Outlawry, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Felony, and for his good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; But within a few days after the ſaid <hi>Dangerfield</hi> producing a <hi>Newgate</hi> Pardon, whereby all Felonies were Pardoned, and his name being found therein, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd.</p>
            <p>And now it was that His Majeſty, in purſuance to what He had done in <hi>April,</hi> and to remove all pretences of the diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, in the Point of Succeſſion, publiſht his Declaration, Proteſting on the Word of a King, and the Faith of a Chriſtian, That He was never Married to Mrs. <hi>Bar low</hi> alias
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61366:49"/> 
               <hi>Waters,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Mother, nor to any other Woman, beſides the now Queen. Which Declaration was on the 15th of <hi>June</hi> in this <hi>Trinity</hi> Term, Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred on Record in the High Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> all the great Lords of the Privy Council who were preſent when His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty Declared and Signed the ſame, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting the Action upon their Corporal Oaths in open Court. The Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor declaring at the ſame time, <q>That this Declaration is not inrolled here to receive any augmentation of repute or force from this Court, for it cannot receive more than it hath already, but only to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved here as in a Repoſitory or Regiſtry; and he doubts not but it will alſo find a more Noble Regiſtry than this, that is, the Hearts of all the Loyal Subjects of the Nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Other notable paſſages are to be Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Term: On the 22d of <hi>June,</hi> the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> was brought to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Bar in Order to his Tryal, but the Attorney-General not being ready with the Kings Evidence, the Tryal was put off to the <hi>Fryday</hi> following, on which Day the Court did not proceed to the Tryal for the ſame reaſon, and the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:61366:49"/> was Bail'd the next Day, to appear the firſt Day of next Term. On the 23d of the ſame Month, the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> was Tryed for High Treaſon; the Evidence againſt him <hi>Oates,</hi> and <hi>Dangerfield;</hi> the laſt of which tho' admitted to be Sworn, yet finding no credit with the Court and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the account of the Infamy of his many Crimes, the Verdict was brought in Not Guilty, and the Priſoner Diſcharged. And this was becauſe the <hi>Stat.</hi> 13 of this King, requires two Lawful and credible Witneſſes in Caſes of Treaſon, and <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield</hi> being not eſteem'd ſuch, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd only one Witneſs, <hi>viz. Oates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 26th of <hi>June,</hi> being four Days before the Term ended, the Grand Jury of <hi>Middleſex</hi> came to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Bar, and by their Foreman, <hi>Charles Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrevile</hi> Eſq; preſented to the Bench a Petition Subſcribed by 21 of them, and deſired my Lord Chief Juſtice to preſent it to the King, for the ſitting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; but the Court refuſing to Act in it, received it not. And the ſaid Jury were at the ſame time Diſcharged from further attendance. It is ſaid, that they had at that time ſome Bills and Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before them againſt ſeveral Perſons
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61366:50"/> for being Popiſh Recuſants, in Order to their Conviction, all which they would have found and preſented in few Hours time, had they not been Diſcharged; among the reſt a Bill againſt the Duke of <hi>York</hi> brought into the ſaid Jury, and Promoted, and in ſome ſort, atteſted by ſeveral Lords and Members of Parliament, <hi>viz.

            <p>Several Remarkable Paſſages happen'd this long Vacation.

            <p>It was alſo during this Vacation that <hi>Elizabeth Celier</hi> before mention'd Publiſht a Narrative of her Tryal and Sufferings;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61366:52"/> in which were ſome words like Reproach to the Government, for which ſhe was Tryed, found Guilty of Publiſhing a Libel, Fined 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to ſtand Thrice in the Pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Good Behavior during Life, and her Book to be Burnt by the Hangman.</p>
            <p>And now comes on the long expected 21ſt Day of <hi>October,</hi> and with it the firſt Seſſion of this Parliament. The Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which The Duke and Ducheſs of <hi>York</hi> began their Journey for <hi>Scotland,</hi> by Sea; The King Accompanying them as low as <hi>Woolwich,</hi> and there Dineing with them on Shipboard. The ſame Day many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of both Houſes, to the Number of 200 as reported, met in a kind of Caball at Dinner at the Sun Tavern behind the <hi>Exchange.</hi> On the 21ſt the Kings Speech contain'd, <q>That He had during this long Prorogation made Alliances with <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> That He deſired Mony of them for the Relief of <hi>Tangier</hi> which had already exhauſted His Purſe; That He would not have them meddle with the Succeſſion of the Crown in the Right Line, but proceed in the Diſcovery of the Plot, and to the Tryals of the Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this (the Chancellor making no ſet Speech) the Commons return'd to their

            </p>
            <p>One of the firſt things the Houſe of Commons did, was to Purge their own Houſe of certain Members; Sir <hi>Robert Can,</hi> a Burgeſs for <hi>Briſtol</hi> for having ſaid there is no Plot, but a Presbyterian Plot: Sir <hi>Francis Withins</hi> head Steward of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and one of the Burgeſſes for the ſame, for having Declar'd himſelf abhorrent to the late Tumultous Petitions for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments ſitting. The firſt of theſe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd the Houſe, and Committed to the <hi>Tower;</hi> the other only expell'd; But both Order'd to receive their Cenſure on their Knees. And ſeveral other Members were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Guilty of the laſt mention'd Offence.</p>
            <p>On the 30th of <hi>October,</hi> the King Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht a Proclamation, promiſing His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to all that within two Months ſhall come in and make any further Diſcovery of the Plot. And this was done upon an Addreſs of Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Commons not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in puniſhing their own Members who had appear'd againſt Petitioning for the Parliaments fitting, they take notice of others who were without their Walls,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61366:53"/> and among the reſt Sir <hi>George Jeffreys</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Object of their Diſpleaſure; who being Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant at Law, and Chief Juſtice of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> is for the pretended Crime above ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the 13th of <hi>November</hi> Voted a Betrayer of the Rights of the Subject, and an Addreſs Order'd to be made to His Majeſty to remove him from all Publick Offices. At the ſame time it was Order'd, that a Committee enquire into all ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as have been adviſing or promoting the late Proclamation, ſtiled a Proclamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Tumultuous Petitioning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But about the ſame time a matter of much greater concern was thus mannaged. On the 11th of <hi>November,</hi> was paſt in the Houſe of Commons a Bill entituled, <q>An Act for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> to Inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Territories thereunto belonging.</q> Which Bill was on the 15th carryed up to the Lords Houſe by my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by almoſt all the Commons, who gave a Hum at the Delivery. They being departed it was read once, and being put to the Vote, whether it ſhould be read a ſecond time, it was carryed in the <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61366:54"/> by two Voices. On the ſecond read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was debated till 11 a Clock at night (the King being preſent all the while) and then thrown out of the Houſe by a Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of about 30 Votes; in which Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were all the Biſhops then preſent, which were 14.</p>
            <p>Several other matters were tranſacted in Parliament, of great moment, but in regard the Daily Votes and tranſactions of the Houſe of Commons, was by Order of that Houſe, daily made publick in Print, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader for Particulars to what has been publiſht, and in theſe Papers take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice only of ſome of the moſt material Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.</p>
            <p>Among which, it may be obſerved that Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> the late Speaker, and for whoſe Election the Commons in the late ſhort Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did very much ſtickle, was now ordered to be Impeacht; and thò not at the ſame time, yet not long after, Impeachments were Voted and drawn up againſt Sir <hi>Francis North</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> Sir <hi>William Scroggs</hi> Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Jones</hi> ſecond Juſtice of the ſaid Court, and Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> Puiſny Baron of the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61366:54"/> for ſeveral pretended Miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>William</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> one of the 5 Popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> was brought to his Tryal on an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of High Treaſon. The Tryal began in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 30th of <hi>November,</hi> being the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Term ended. Which Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Evidence upon the ſame, was managed by a Committee of the Commons. The Tryal laſted for a Whole Week: and The Evidence againſt him were <hi>Oates, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berville,</hi> and <hi>Dugdale;</hi> Of the Lords who ſate upon the Tryal (the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor being Lord High Steward) 31 pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him not Guilty, and 55 Guilty. And accordingly Judgment was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt him on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 7th of <hi>December.</hi> But his Execution was reſpited till <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 29th of <hi>December,</hi> on which day he was Beheaded on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> proteſting with his laſt breath his Innocency as to thoſe Crimes of which he ſtood Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that <hi>Bethel,</hi> and <hi>Corniſh,</hi> being then Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> and having received the Kings Writ for the Execution of the ſaid Viſcount <hi>Stafford</hi> by ſevering
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61366:55"/> his Head from his Body, (according to the conſtant Courſe in ſuch Caſes) had not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Confidence to demur upon it, whether he ought to be Beheaded, or according to the Common Judgment, hang'd and quartered; and for this they apply'd themſelves to the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, To which the moſt Honourable Houſe of Lords Anſwered roundly, That the Kings Writ ought to be obey'd: But the Commons by way of Conceſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were <hi>Content</hi> that the ſaid Lord be Executed by ſevering his Head from his Body only.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions a Comet with a moſt Prodigious Stream of light appear'd in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> the Star from which the Blaze proceeded was but ſmall, and when firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, appeared not much above the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon;</hi> but every night afterwards it appear'd higher and higher in the beginning of the Night, and conſequently ſetting later and later, its Luſtre and magnitude alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying.</p>
            <p>I am neither able nor willing to make any Remarques on the Nature of theſe <hi>Meteors;</hi> Or to ſay how far ſuch noxious Exhalations may incline Mankind to Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: And leaſt of all will I pretend to Interpret whether this Finger of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61366:55"/> is thus ſeen in the Heavens to Point out Good or Bad Events. All that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is innocently to obſerve, and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Naked Matters of Fact as they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, without diſguize or Comment.</p>
            <p>Two things more very obſervable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd before Chriſtmaſs. One was, An Addreſs of the Houſe of Commons preſented to His Majeſty on the 21ſt of <hi>December,</hi> in anſwer to His Speech of the 15th, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he demanded, once more, Supplies of Mony for the defence of <hi>Tangier.</hi> The effect of the ſaid Addreſs, was to deny (in as modeſt Terms as could be) all Supplies of Mony for that purpoſe; unleſs His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would be pleas'd to paſs a Bill to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from Inheriting to the Crown, and to enable the Proteſtants of this Nation to Aſſociate themſelves for the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion, the Defence of the King and Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The other was a moſt Remarkable Speech Spoke in the Houſe of Lords by the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> the King being then preſent, (at leaſt wiſe ſo pretended and Printed) which being full of Audacious and undecent Expreſſions, was by order of the Lords Houſe, burnt by the Common Hangman at the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and in the <hi>Pallace yard.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:61366:56"/>
            <p>On the 4th of <hi>January</hi> His Majeſty was pleaſed to ſend His Meſſage to the Houſe of Commons, in Anſwer to their Addreſs of <hi>December,</hi> 21. abovemention'd, in which Meſſage He let them know, <q>That he had received their Addreſs with all the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition they could wiſh to comply with their reaſonable Deſires; but upon peruſal of it, he was ſorry to ſee their thoughts ſo wholly fixt on the Bill of Excluſion, as to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that all other remedies for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Popery will be ineffectual; That His Majeſty is confirm'd in His opinion againſt That Bill by the Judgment of the Houſe of Lords who rejected it; That He thinks there remains nothing more for Him to ſay in Anſwer to the foreſaid Addreſs, then to recommend to this Houſe, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all other means for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, to which they have no reaſon to doubt His concurrence, whenſoever they ſhall be preſented to Him in a Parliamentary way; And in concluſion, again, He urges them to the preſervation of <hi>Tangeir.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>Friday</hi> following, being the 7th of <hi>January,</hi> the Houſe entred upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſaid Meſſage, and reſolve, as the opinion of the Houſe, <q>That there is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61366:56"/> no ſecurity or ſafety for the Proteſtant Religion, the Kings Life, or the Well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and eſtabliſht Government of this Kingdom, without paſſing a Bill for diſabling <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> to inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions and Territories there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging; and that to rely upon any other means or remedies without ſuch a Bill, is not only inſufficient, but dangerous: That till ſuch a Bill be paſt this Houſe cannot give any Supply to His Majeſty without danger to His Majeſties perſon, Extream hazard of the Proteſtant Religion, and unfaithfullneſs to thoſe by whom this Houſe is intruſted: That all perſons who adviſed His Majeſty in His laſt Meſſage to this Houſe to inſiſt upon an opinion againſt the Bill for Excluding the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> have given Pernicious Council to His Majeſty, and are Promoters of Popery, and Enemies to the King and Kingdom:</q> And as ſuch they name <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Hallifax, Henry</hi> Marquiſs of <hi>Worceſter, Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> againſt which, as alſo againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> Earl of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and <hi>Laurence Hide</hi> Eſq; they Vote an Addreſs to be preſented to His Majeſty to remove them from all Offices of Honour and Profit, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61366:57"/> from His Majeſties Councils and Preſence for ever. They further Vote and Reſolve, the ſame day, <q>That whoſoever ſhall heraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lend or cauſe to be Lent by way of advance any Mony upon the Branches of the Kings Revenue ariſing by Cuſtoms, Exciſe, or Hearth Mony, ſhall be adjudg'd to hinder the ſitting of Parliaments, and ſhall be reſponſible for the ſame in Parliament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>Monday</hi> following, being the 10th of <hi>Jan.</hi> the King was pleas'd to determin this Seſſion, by Proroguing the Parliament to the 20th day of <hi>Jan.</hi> then next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; at the ſame time paſſing only Two Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Bills, <hi>viz.</hi> One about <hi>Iriſh Cattel,</hi> and One about <hi>Burying in Woollen.</hi> The Houſe of Commons were, it ſeems, aware of this Prorogation, and therefore that very morning the firſt thing they did, after they were ſate, and before the Uſher of the Black Rod came in, they Reſolved, <q>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever adviſed His Majeſty to Prorogue this Parliament, to any other purpoſe then in Order to the paſſing of a Bill for the Excluſion of <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> is a Betrayer of the King, the Proteſtant Religion, and of the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a Promoter of the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and a Penſioner to <hi>France.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61366:57"/>
            <p>On the 13th of <hi>Jan.</hi> a Court of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council, being Aſſembled in <hi>London,</hi> they ordered to be drawn up, and Preſented to the King a Petition, ſetting forth, <q>That whereas, the Parliament had convicted one of the 5 Popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and were about to convict the other 4 of High Treaſon; That they had Impeacht the Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> and were about to impeach other Judges, and all this in order to the preſervation of His Majeſties Life, the Proteſtant Religion, and Government; That they were much ſurprized to ſee the Parliament Prorogued in the hight of their buiſineſs; That their only hopes were that this was done only in order to bring ſuch Affairs about again as were neceſſary to the Settling the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They therefore pray'd that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would be pleas'd to let the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſit at the day appointed, and ſo to continue till they had effected the great Affairs before them.</q> To this effect were the words of their Petition, which was further ordered to be delivered that night, or as ſoon as may be, by the Lord Mayor, attended with the new Recorder <hi>George Treby</hi> Eſq; and certain Members of the Court of Aldermen, and Common Council.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:61366:58"/>
            <p>But before the ſaid 20th day of <hi>Jan.</hi> arrived, the King was pleaſed by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation bearing date at <hi>Whitehall, Jan.</hi> 18. to diſſolve this Parliament, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate His Royal pleaſure and intentions to call an other to ſit on the 21ſt of <hi>March</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after this, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 25th of <hi>Jan.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and other Lords Preſented to the King a Petition, ſetting forth, <q>That whereas the Nation and His Majeſties Perſon were in imminent danger from the Papiſts, unto which no ſtop or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy could be provided unleſs by a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; That ſeveral Parliaments being call'd and aſſembled, they were Prorogued and diſſolved before any ſufficient order could be taken therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That His Majeſty had been prevailed with to call another at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where neither Lords or Commons can be in ſafety, but will be dayly expoſed to the Swords of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and their adherents, the liberty of ſpeaking thereby deſtroyed, and the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of their Acts and proceedings left diſputable, the ſtraightneſs of the place unfit for ſuch a Concourſe of perſons as now follows every Parliament, and the Witneſſes which are neceſſary to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61366:58"/> upon the Commons Impeachment unable to bear the charges of ſuch a Journey, and unwilling to truſt themſelves under the Protection of a Parliament, that is it ſelf evidently under the Power of Guards and Soldiers; They therefore pray that the Parliament may ſit at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </q> This was ſubſcribed, <hi>Monmouth, Kent, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, Bedford, Salisbury, Clare, Stamford, Eſſex, Shaftsbury, Mordant, Evers, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>About the ſame time the King was pleaſed to diſplace my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> from the Office of Secretary of State, and to confer the ſaid Office on my Lord <hi>Conway:</hi> and ſeveral other Members of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were then alſo alter'd.</p>
            <p>And thus concluded the 32d year of His Majeſties Reign, obſervable for divers matters, but above all for the Tranſactions of the Lords in Parliament, who by their Prudent and Judicious proceedings on the 15th of <hi>November,</hi> defeated the induſtrious malice of the Dukes Enemies, by rejecting the Bill paſt by the Commons for ſecluding him from the Succeſſion of theſe Crowns, when they ſhould happen to fall to him by the old known Laws of Inheritance. Which action being of ſuch mighty Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61366:59"/> to the Peace, or perpetual Trouble of this Nation, and the Queſtion being ſo happily ſettled, it being alſo a leading Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to many other healing actions which have happen'd ſince, let me once take leave to break the conciſe Method which I at the beginning of theſe Notes propounded, and remember in this place ſome Verſes writ immediately upon that Tranſaction, by a true Lover of his King and the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>

            <head>Anno 33. <hi>Car. 2. Anno Dom.</hi> 1681.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of this Year, City and Country were buſy in the Election of Members to ſerve in the next Parliament to be holden at <hi>Oxford.</hi> For the moſt part the Old Members were choſen again. I ſhall give a ſhort account of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd at <hi>London</hi> on this occaſion, by which a gueſs or eſtimate may be made of the Tranſactions elſewhere. The Election for that City was perform'd at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> on <hi>Fryday</hi> the 4th of <hi>February,</hi> and the choice which the Common Hall fixt upon, were Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Player, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Pilkinton,</hi> and <hi>William Love</hi> Eſquires; To which four, as ſoon as the Election was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61366:60"/> over, a Paper was preſented in the Name of the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> then Aſſembled in Common Hall, containing a return of <q>their moſt hearty thanks for their faithful and unweary'd endeavors, in the two laſt Parliaments, to ſearch into and Diſcover the depth of the Plot, to preſerve His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Royal Perſon, the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the well Eſtabliſht Government of this Realm, to ſecure the meeting and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of frequent Parliaments, to aſſert our undoubted Rights of Petitioning, and to puniſh ſuch who would have betray'd thoſe Rights, to promote the long wiſht for U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, to Repeal the 35. <hi>El.</hi> and the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Act, and more eſpecially for their endeavors in promoting the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York:</hi> In fine they conclude, that being confidently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that they (the ſaid Members for the City) will never conſent to the granting any Mony-ſupply, till they have effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecured us againſt Popery and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power, they reſolve, by Gods aſſiſtance to ſtand by their ſaid Members, with their Lives and Fortunes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this another Paper was preſented from the ſaid Citizens, to the two Sheriffs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61366:61"/> them, in the Name of all the ſaid Citizens then Aſſembled in Common Hall to return their grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and by him to the reſt of the Lords, who preſented the late Petition and Advice to His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>In like manner, were the former Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, again Choſen, in moſt places; and in many, ſuch Papers of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs preſented to them, in their reſpective Countries, as had been done by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty of <hi>London</hi> to their Members. Alſo, (contrary to the Old Cuſtomes of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Treating the Country where they ſtood) now the Country in moſt places Treated them, or at leaſt every Man bore his own Charges.</p>
            <p>About a Week before the Seſſion, the King left <hi>London,</hi> and removed to <hi>Oxford,</hi> appointing certain Companies of Foot, and Troops of Horſe to keep Gariſon in the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> during His abſence. Many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe of Commons, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe of <hi>London,</hi> went to <hi>Oxford</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd, or attended, with the Cerimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Cavalcade of a numerous Train of Friends.</p>
            <p>On the 14th of <hi>March,</hi> The King and Queen enter'd <hi>Oxford,</hi> Received and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61366:61"/> by the Mayor and Body of that City at the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-Gate, and from thence attended with Acclamations and all ſort of Demonſtrations of Joy to <hi>Chriſt-Church;</hi> The next Day, the Body of the Univerſity waited on Their Majeſties, and received the Honour to kiſs Their Hands, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time to the King a large <hi>Oxford</hi> Bible, and to the Queen, the Cuts belonging to the Hiſtory and Antiquities of the Univerſity, both Richly Bound.</p>
            <p>The 21ſt of <hi>March</hi> being now arrived, and the Members of both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Aſſembled at <hi>Oxford,</hi> according to the Kings Writs of Summons, the Lords ſate in the Gallery at the Schools, and the Commons in the Convocation Houſe.</p>
            <p>His Majeſties Speech, at the opening of the Seſſions contained, <q>That the unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Proceedings of the laſt Houſe of Commons were the occaſion of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the laſt Parliament; That as he will never uſe Arbitrary Government, himſelf, ſo He is reſolved never to ſuffer it in others; That whoſoever ſhall calmly conſider the Proceedings in the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, may perhaps, more wonder at His Patience ſo long, than that He grew weary at laſt; That it is as much His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61366:62"/> and care as theirs to preſerve the Liberty of the Subject, becauſe the Crown can never be ſafe when that is in Danger; that neither Liberty nor Property can ſubſiſt long when the juſt Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown are Invaded, or the Honour of the Government brought low and into diſreputation; that He hath call'd this Parliament ſo ſoon to ſhew that no Irregularities in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall make him out of Love with them; That the Juſt care they ought to have of Religion ought not to be ſo managed and improved into unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fears as to be made a Pretence for Changing the Foundation of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that He hopes the Example of the ill ſucceſs of former heats will diſpoſe them to a better Temper; that they would not lay ſo much weight upon any one Expedient againſt Popery, as to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all other are ineffectual; that they ought to remember that without the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Dignity of the Monarchy, neither Religion nor Property can be preſerved; that He cannot depart from what he had formerly ſo often declar'd touching the Succeſſion, but to remove all reaſonable fears that may ariſe from the poſſibility
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61366:62"/> of a Popiſh Succeſſors coming to the Crown, if means can be found out; that in ſuch a Caſe the Adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may remain in Proteſtant Hands, he ſhall be ready to hearken to any ſuch Expedient by which the Religion may be preſerved and the Monarchy not deſtroy'd; that therefore they would provide for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Government together with regard to one another, becauſe they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port one another, and that they would make the known Eſtabliſht Laws of the Land, the Rules and Meaſures of all their Votes, becauſe He is reſolved they ſhall be His.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this Speech the Commons return'd to their Houſe, and Choſe for their Speaker, <hi>William Williams</hi> Eſq; who had managed that Office in the laſt Parliament. Who being the next Day preſented, made a Speech to the King and <hi>claim'd</hi> by humble Addreſs (as his Words were) <hi>The Antient Rights of the Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing of extraordinary note paſſed till <hi>Saturday</hi> the 26th of <hi>March,</hi> on which Day it was that the Houſe of Commons were informed that the Lords had refuſed to proceed upon the Impeachment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons againſt <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris</hi> for High
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61366:63"/> Treaſon, but had directed that he ſhould be proceeded againſt at the Common Law; Hereupon they Vote, <q>That this refuſal of the Lords to proceed in Parliament upon ſuch Impeachment, is a Denial of Juſtice, and a Violation of the Conſtitutions of Parliaments, an Obſtruction to the further Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, and of great Danger to His Majeſties Perſon and the Proteſtant Religion: And further, they reſolve, That for any inferior Court to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> or any other Perſon lying under an Impeachment in Parliament for the ſame Crimes for which he or they ſtand Impeached, is an high breach of the Priviledge of Parliament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>Monday</hi> following the Bill againſt the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was Read the firſt time, and Order'd a ſecond Reading: When on a ſuddain the King ſends for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons up to the Houſe of Lords, and tells them, <q>That He perceived heats betwixt the Lords and them, and therefore He had Order'd the Chancellor to Diſſolve the preſent Parliament,</q> which he accordingly did immediately.</p>
            <p>The ſame Day the King left <hi>Oxford,</hi> and came to <hi>Windſor</hi> that Night; the next Morning by Eight a Clock, to <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:61366:63"/>
            <p>Not long after this His Majeſty was pleas'd to Publiſh in Print a Declaration, to all his Loving Subjects, in which He ſet forth the Reaſons which induced Him to Diſſolve His two laſt Parliaments, His reaſonable deſires which He had propoſed to 'em, with their unwarrantable proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in return; declaring however that He is not yet out of Love with Parliaments, but that He will frequently adviſe with them as His great Council, which He hopes ere long to find in a better Temper; much to this purpoſe were the Contents of that Declaration, which by His Majeſties Order in Council was appointed to be Read in all Churches and Chappels.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time all the Factious News, call'd <hi>Domeſtick Intelligence,</hi> and Weekly Printed for <hi>Francis Smith, Ben. Harris,</hi> and <hi>Langly Curtis,</hi> were by Order of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil (as reported) put down and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: And the abovemention'd <hi>Francis Smith</hi> a Notorious Libel Printer, was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Eaſter Term</hi> this year, Sir <hi>Francis Pemberton</hi> became Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> in the Room of Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61366:64"/> Scroggs</hi> who had obtain'd a Writ of Eaſe. Great Expectation there was to ſee what the Court would do in the Caſe of <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> and ſome Heſitation the Grand-Jury of <hi>Middleſex</hi> (of which one Mr. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> Brother and Heir to the late Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> was the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) made to receive the Bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him, in regard he had been Impeacht by the Houſe of Commons, till they were inform'd and ſatisfied by the Court that all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> had the Day before met and reſolved upon that queſtion, <hi>Nemine Contrad cente,</hi> that they might lawfully proceed in the Tryal not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the aforemention'd Votes of the Houſe of Commons; after this the ſaid Jury found the Bill, and <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was Arraign'd at the Bar on the laſt Day of <hi>April;</hi> he was thrice bid to hold up his Hand, inſiſting upon the Impeachment in Parliament, but at laſt he held up his Hand and heard his Indictment Read; which was for High Treaſon, expreſt in a certain Writing call'd <hi>The True Engliſhman,</hi> full of moſt horrid Expreſſions againſt the King, as if he were a Conſpirator in the Plot, and exciting the Nation to riſe as one Man againſt him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61366:64"/> he put into Court a Dilatory Plea, againſt the Juriſdiction, alledging that he being Impeacht by the Commons in Parliament, he cannot be Tryed here, but this Plea not being under Councils Hand was refuſed to be received; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Court gave him time to conſider whether he would ſtand by ſuch a Plea, in regard it might be fatal unto him in caſe it ſhould be over-Ruled; and aſſign'd him for Council Sir <hi>Francis Winnington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pollexfen,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop</hi> (as he deſired) to argue the ſaid Point of Judicature next <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> if he perſiſted in ſuch Plea. On the ſaid <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> being the 4th of <hi>May</hi> the Priſoner was again brought to the Bar, attended with His Council; at which time the Kings Attorney Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer,</hi> enter'd a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer to the Priſoners Plea, and inſiſted chiefly on the manifeſt defect of form, in regard the Plea run that the ſaid <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was Impeacht at the late Parliament, at <hi>Oxford, de Alta proditione,</hi> but does not ſay of what ſort or manner of Treaſon, nor ſets forth the Impeachment at large, which a Plea ought to do, when it is to the Juriſdiction. After this the Council of the Priſoner joyn'd in Demurrer, but upon
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61366:65"/> their earneſt motion, (tho' oppoſed by the Attorney General) time was given them to next <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning to maintain the ſaid Plea by Argument, if they can. At which time it was argued largely by <hi>Williams, Winnington, Wallop,</hi> and <hi>Pollexfen</hi> for the Priſoner, and by the Attorney General, the Sollicitor, Serjeant <hi>Jeoffreys</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Withens</hi> for the King; the Kings Council, and alſo the Court, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they medled not at all with the Priviledge of the Houſe of Commons or Juriſdiction of the Lords in Parliament, which was not in the Point (tho in truth the Council for the Priſoner would fain have put that upon 'em) but only as to the form of the Plea. After all the debate, which laſted from, 8 till after 12 that Day, the Lord Chief Juſtice declar'd that the Court would take a convenient time to conſider before they gave their Judgment.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following being the 11th of <hi>May,</hi> the Priſoner being again brought to the Bar by the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> my Lord Chief Juſtice, in the Name of the whole Court gave Judgment, and declar'd, That he and his Brothers had Conſider'd of the Plea, that they had alſo conſulted with others of the Judges, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61366:65"/> that himſelf, Juſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> were of opinion that the Plea was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient (<hi>Dolbin</hi> doubting) the Plea was therefore over ruled; and the Priſoner ordered to Plead over; and accordingly he pleaded not Guilty, and alledging that a material Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on his part was now in <hi>Holland,</hi> His Tryal was put off till the firſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> next Term, which is the 9th of <hi>June.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 14 of <hi>May,</hi> being the laſt day but one of the <hi>Term,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> was brought by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> from the <hi>Tower</hi> to the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar, where by his Council he urged hard that he might be Bail'd, but the Court being unſatisfied that they had ſufficient Juriſdiction in his Caſe (he being committed by Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and, as it ſeemd, not being within the benefit of the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act) he was remanded back to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the laſt day of <hi>Eaſter Term, Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> was again brought into the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Court, to give Evidence to the Grand-Jury upon a Bill of Indictment againſt <hi>De Puy</hi> (who had been Groom of the Robes to the Duke) The Jury deſired that the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might be given to them privately,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61366:66"/> But the Court overruled that, and <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> declared upon Oath (Publickly in Court) a great deal of Scandalous ſtuff, not fit to be mentioned, relating to the Death of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> which the ſaid <hi>De Puy</hi> had told him a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Death of the ſaid Knight; but all this <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſpoke from <hi>De Puy</hi>'s mouth: Of his own knowledge he ſaid only this, That the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> coming down the great Stairs at <hi>Winſor,</hi> he heard him ſay, that now he would make <hi>Godfreys</hi> heart ake: To this he added, that <hi>De Puy</hi> told him preſently after the Murder, that the Earl had ſent <hi>Godfrey</hi> on an arrant from which he would never return. Upon this Evidence the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s name was inſerted into the Bill of Indictment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>De Puy</hi> as acceſſary to the ſaid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> and the Bill was accordingly found againſt them both.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time it was that the ſaid Jury preſented the Court with a Petition, that they would intercede with the King for the ſitting and Continuance of a new Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:61366:66"/>
            <p>During all this <hi>Eaſter Term,</hi> and many Months after, many Loyal Addreſſes flowed to the King from all parts of <hi>England,</hi> full of Congratulations, and nothing of that factious ſtrain, which had almoſt rendred the very word Petitioning to be ſcandalous; among theſe Loyal Addreſſes, that from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> ran higheſt for the Kings Prerogative, and a little reflecting on the exorbitances of the late Commons; but as if this were a notorious Scandal to the Parliament, the Grand-Jury of <hi>Middleſex</hi> above mentioned preſented the ſame as a publick Libel; but this did not diſcourage the Loyal party who ſtill continued their Addreſſes. It would be tedious to name all, and how kindly they were received by the King, who never ſuffered thoſe who brought 'em, to depart without ſome gracious mark of His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor. Not ſo to thoſe who took upon them in their Petitions to direct His Majeſty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Calling and continuance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments. To this Purpoſe its obſervable that the City of <hi>London</hi> were divided in theſe matters, Part of them (being moſt of the Court of Aldermen, and ſome of the Common-Council) had drawn up a Loyal Addreſs, in like manner as the whole
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61366:67"/> Burrough of <hi>Southwark</hi> had done; this they Preſented to the King at <hi>Windſor</hi> by the Hands of Sir <hi>William Turner</hi> and Sir <hi>John Moor,</hi> with abundance of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Favour: But another Party ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving compoſed a far different Petition both for form and matter, and it being alſo the ſame Day carried to <hi>Windſor</hi> by the Lord Mayor, one Alderman, and the Recorder, they were refuſed to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Kings Preſence, but orderd to attend at the Council at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following, where they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Repremend from my Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>Finch</hi> (now newly created Earl of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham.</hi>) At the ſame time it was that the Leiutenancy of the City of <hi>London</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Loyal Offers of their Lives and Fortunes; among theſe was Sir <hi>George Jeffryes</hi> the Kings Serjeant, and late Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>London,</hi> with his Sword on, as one of the ſaid Leiutenancy.</p>
            <p>On the 8th of <hi>June,</hi> in <hi>Trinity Term,</hi> was Dr. <hi>Oliver Plunket</hi> Tryed for High Treaſon at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar; the Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him were all profeſt Papiſts, (as ſaid) and came out of <hi>Ireland:</hi> the chief matters Sworn againſt him, <q>That
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61366:67"/> he was made Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the <hi>Pope</hi> at the King of <hi>France</hi>'s recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that upon that account he having ingaged to do that King all the Service he could, he had actually Levied among his Popiſh Clergy great Sums of Mony, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to introduce the <hi>French</hi> Dominion into that Kingdom, and extirminate the Proteſtants.</q> Upon this Evidence he was found Guilty.</p>
            <p>The next day being <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 9th of <hi>June, Fitz-Harris</hi> was Tryed at the ſame Bar for High Treaſon, the chief Evidence againſt him were, <hi>Everard,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller;</hi> for the Priſoner appear'd <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Colonel Manſell,</hi> and told a long ſtory, Scandalous in it ſelf, but of no weight; My Lord Chief Juſtice therefore (according to the Evidence which was home and clear againſt the Priſoner) directed the Jury to find for the King, which being alſo the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the other 3 Judges, the Jury after above an half hours conſultation, brought in their Verdict, Guilty.</p>
            <p>Preſently after this Tryal Mrs. <hi>Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> the Priſoners wife, and her Maid, accuſed my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſcrick</hi> of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of that Treaſonable Libel of which her Husband was Convicted; upon which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61366:68"/> accuſation the ſaid Lord was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, <hi>June</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following, being the 15th of <hi>June, Plunket,</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> were ſeverally brought to the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar, and received Judgment of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as in caſes of High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>About this time it was that the King in Council was pleas'd to order a Parliament to be call'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> on the 28th of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt not forget, that on the laſt day of <hi>Trin. Term,</hi> a Bill of Indictment againſt the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> being delivered in to the Grand-Jury of <hi>Edmunton</hi> Hundred, then ſerving in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> Sworn to by Mrs. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and her Maid and ſome others, and the ſaid Jury not thinking the Evidence ſufficient, they were about to indorſe it with an <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> when Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> one of the Clerks of the Crown Office attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, withdraw'd it from before 'em. Of this action they complain'd to the Court, but being told that the Attorney General might ſtop theſe proceedings as he ſaw occaſion, or words to that purpoſe, with which the Jury being nothing ſatisfied, they went immediately and preferr'd a Bill
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61366:68"/> of Indictment againſt the ſaid <hi>Ward</hi> to the July of <hi>Oſwelſton</hi> Hundred, then attending, for this miſdemanor; which Bill the ſaid laſt mention'd Jury found.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the Firſt of <hi>July,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oliver Plunket</hi> the Popiſh Primat of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> were both Executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for the ſeveral Treaſons of which they were ſeverally Tryed and Condemn'd the laſt Term. <hi>Plunket</hi> in a long Speech declar'd his Innocency, forgave his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Pray'd for the King, Queen, and Duke of <hi>York.</hi> But <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> ſaid very little, the ſubſtance of what he had to ſay or diſcover, being by him delivered to Dr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> Miniſter of the <hi>Tower,</hi> for his Wife; and therefore it is to be preſumed that he Dyed no Papiſt, in regard he had the aſſiſtance of a Proteſtant Miniſter, which all Papiſts have been known to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refuſe on thoſe occaſions. His Diſcovery is ſince Printed.</p>
            <p>About this time ſeveral Factious People were committed to the <hi>Tower</hi> for High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, namely, <hi>Rouſe, Hayns, White,</hi> and one <hi>Colledge,</hi> commonly call'd the <hi>Proteſtant Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> But above all let it be remember'd, that on <hi>July,</hi> 2. the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> commonly call'd, by way of Excellency,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61366:69"/> 
               <hi>The Proteſtant Earl,</hi> was before the Council at <hi>Whit hall</hi> (to which the King came from <hi>Windſor</hi> that day on purpoſe) accuſed of High Treaſon, and for the ſame, committed to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and his Papers ſeized.</p>
            <p>At the Seſſions at the <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> which followed ſoon after, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> moved to be Bail'd, but they were anſwered by the unanimous opinion of the Judges, That it was not in the Power of that Court to Bail out of the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame Seſſions it was that a Bill of Indictment of High Treaſon, was delivered to the Grand-Jury of <hi>London,</hi> againſt <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>the Proteſtant Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> but the Jury (made for the purpoſe as is ſuppoſed) appear'd ſo partial and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary in their proceeding, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the home Oaths of ſeveral Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, among which were <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> two of the great Evidence againſt the Plotters, and another who had been a Member of the Houſe of Commons, they brought in the Bill, <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> But ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bill being exhibited ſoon after, to the Grand-Jury at the Aſſizes at <hi>Oxford,</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Colledge</hi> (part of the Treaſonable Words and Matters being Tranſacted there,)
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61366:69"/> the Bill was found there, on the ſame Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which was rejected at the <hi>Old Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> And in <hi>Auguſt</hi> he was Tryed, Condemn'd and Executed at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Weather that happen'd this Summer was memorable for an extraordinary Drought all over <hi>England,</hi> and alſo beyond Sea, all <hi>April, May,</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> and ſome part of <hi>July;</hi> but about the beginning of <hi>July</hi> fell ſuch plentiful Rains, that the Ground, which in all parts was Scorcht up like the High-Ways almoſt to a miracle became as freſh and Green again, as on <hi>May</hi> Day: Dayſeys and the other Flowers of the Spring appear'd again towards the End of <hi>July;</hi> With Graſs in abundance in ſome places, and expectations of a ſecond Hay-time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the want of the firſt.</p>
            <p>On the 28 of <hi>July</hi> the Parliament ſate in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where his Royal Highneſs Preſided as His Majeſties High Commiſſioner. At the opening of the Seſſions the Kings Letter was read, ſetting forth, That He had call'd them at that time to adviſe of ſuch things as may truly conduce to the ſecurity and Intereſt of that Kingdom, and as an eminent Expreſſion of His Favor, He hath named his moſt dear and moſt intirely beloved Brother <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>York</hi> to be His
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61366:70"/> Commiſſioner there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this the Duke made a Speech, <q>Declaring the high eſteem he had of the great Honor and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs the King had been pleaſed to do him in making choice of him to ſerve as his Commiſſioner in that his antient Kingdom, ſince it ſhews to all the World the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the King hath for him and Confidence he hath in him, and capacitates him, not only to ſerve His Majeſty as becomes a Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subject, but alſo to evince the real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern he hath for the good of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and his readineſs to ſerve it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove its Intereſt; That His Majeſty had commanded him to aſſure them, that he will inviolably maintain and protect the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion as by Law Eſtabliſht in that Kingdom, and the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, That he will maintain and allow the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Rights of His Subjects according to the due courſe of Law, and that he doth expect that they will not be ſhort of the Loyalty of their Anceſtors in vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly aſſerting and cleering His Royal Prerogative, and in declaring the Rights of His Crown in its natural and Legal courſe of Deſcent. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>

            <p>After this the Duke entertained the whole Parliament at a Splendid and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Feaſt; The Lords by themſelves, and the Commons by themſelves at ſeveral Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
            <p>On the Firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> The Parliament returned a moſt Loyal and Dutiful Anſwer to His Majeſties Letter, which Anſwer being ſo mighty full of true Loyalty, it would be an Injury to abridge it in this place; every Line, every word carrying the true and emphatical marks of gratitude and Duty: I therefore refer to the Print. Alſo in purſuance and Confirmation of their Loyal Affections, on the 14th of <hi>Aug.</hi> the Parliament paſt a Bill entituled <q>An Act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging and aſſerting the Right of Succeſſion to the Imperial Crown of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> By which they recognize and declare, That the ſaid Crown is by Inherent Right, and the nature of the Monarchy, as well as by the fundamental and unalterable Law of the Realm, tranſmitted and devolved by Lineal Succeſſion, according to proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Blood, and that no difference in Religion, no Law nor Act of Parliament can alter or divert the Right of Succeſſion and Lineal deſcent of the Crown to the neereſt and Lawful Heirs, and therefore
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61366:71"/> they declare it High Treaſon, by Writing Speaking or any other manner of way to endeavor the alteration, ſuſpenſion or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Right of Succeſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time they paſt another Act ratifying all former Laws for the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>On the 31ſt of <hi>Auguſt, Oates</hi> was by Order of Council expell'd from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> his Sallery taken off, and accuſed of Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors.</p>
            <p>Great Numbers of Poor <hi>French</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, about this time, flockt over out of <hi>France,</hi> to whom our King was ſo Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as by Act of Council to declare His Pleaſure, that all His Officers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſhould give 'em the ſame Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Favour with His own Subjects, That He would take 'em into His Protection, That He would grant 'em His Letters of Denization, forthwith upon their requeſt, and That He would intercede with the next Parliament to obtain for them an Act of Naturalization.

            </p>
            <p>This Summer the King was pleas'd to appoint under Him, certain Deputies, or Commiſſioners of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs; to whom He delegated His Power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Preferments which belong to His immediate Patronage.

            <p>At the Seſſions for <hi>London</hi> held at this time, one <hi>Rouſe</hi> being Charged with High Treaſon, and a Bill of Indictment Exhibited to the Grand Jury attending for that City, againſt Him, They found the Bill <hi>Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> after the ſame manner as had been formerly done in the Caſe of <hi>Colledge.</hi>

Several Bonfires were made that Night in the City, at which ſeveral Riotous Actions were Committed. In particular one Capt. <hi>Griffith</hi> living in <hi>Newgate-ſtreet,</hi> a Capt. of the Trained Bands and a Common Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, coming home about 11 at Night, and finding a Bonfire neer his own Door, and endeavouring to oppoſe it, was knockt down, wounded in the Head, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of His Life: Others were ſeen about the ſame time of Night to march through <hi>Warwick-Lane,</hi> one of which had his Sword drawn, crying no <hi>York,</hi> no Popiſh Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and at the ſame time crying up a <hi>Monmouth,</hi> a <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> a <hi>Buckingham;</hi>

            <p>On the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the laſt day of the Term, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> priſoners in the Tower, were admitted to Bail in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had for his Bail the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Sir <hi>William Cooper,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mountigue,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi> Himſelf was bound in a Recognizance of 3000 <hi>l.</hi> and the Bail each in 1500 <hi>l.</hi> The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was alſo Bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame manner. By Order of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to the Lord Mayor, and from him to the Officers of every Ward and Pariſh, all Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires and Bells Ringing were Prohibited that Night.</p>
            <p>The Act of Teſt which paſt in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>Scotland</hi> the laſt Seſſions, was the occaſion of ſeveral Diſcontents and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions amongſt the Fanatick Party there. The Act enjoyn'd a certain Oath or Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be taken by all Officers in Church and State, and Graduates in their Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, to maintain the Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as now Eſtabliſht; which Teſt tho' explain'd and qualified, was notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo contrary to the ſenſe of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Party in that Kingdom, that ſeveral of their Miniſters refuſed it, and ſome of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61366:73"/> Laity, among whom of greateſt note was <hi>Archibald Campbel</hi> Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> a Man of ſuch Turbulent behaviour, that he was about this time Impeacht of High Treaſon, and found Guilty: But being after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction kept for ſome time a Priſoner at <hi>Edinborough,</hi> he found means to make his Eſcape (into <hi>England</hi> as ſome thought, where he harbour'd unknown) after whoſe flight his Arms were, with all publick Solemnity, reverſt and torn, and ſuch other marks of diſhonour denounced againſt him, as in ſuch like Caſes are, by the Cuſtoms of <hi>Scotland,</hi> due to Traytors.</p>
            <p>The Proceedings of the Juſtices of Peace for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> at their Seſſions at <hi>Hick-Hall,</hi> before <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> were of note on diverſe accounts; Firſt, They order'd by their publick Act of Seſſions dated the 13th of <hi>January,</hi> that whereas the Conſtables and Church Wardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of every Pariſh and Precinct within the ſaid County, had been enjoyn'd laſt Seſſions to make a Return the firſt Day of this, of the Names of the Preachers in Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and the moſt conſiderable frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſame within their ſeveral Limits, which Order not being obey'd, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd by ſome, it was therefore by the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61366:74"/> Juſtices then Aſſembled, deſired that the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> will pleaſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thoſe Officers which are under his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, to uſe their utmoſt diligence, that all ſuch Perſons may be Excommunicated who commit crimes deſerving that Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical cenſure, and that the ſaid Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications may be Publiſhed in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes where the Perſons live, that they may be taken notice of, and obvious to the Penalties that belong to Perſons Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to be admitted for a Witneſs, or returned upon Juries, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſue for any Debt. And they further Order'd at the ſaid Seſſions, that the <hi>Stat. 1. El.</hi> and 3. <hi>Jac.</hi> be put in due execution, for the Levying 1 s. <hi>per Sunday</hi> upon ſuch Perſons who repair not to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service and Sermons at their Pariſh, or ſome other publick Church.</p>
            <p>Alſo there was another Act of the ſame Seſſions at <hi>Hicks-Hall,</hi> which bore Date the 18th of <hi>January,</hi> with which the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace attended upon His Majeſty at <hi>White-Hall</hi> the ſame Day, and preſented the Paper to His Royal Hands. It contain'd, <q>That they the ſaid Juſtices, were ſenſible of their great Honour and happineſs in being the firſt who return'd their humble and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61366:74"/> hearty acknowledgment for His moſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Declaration, which being followed by a multitude of Addreſſes from all Parts of the Kingdom, His Majeſty hath had a full Diſcovery of His Peoples affections, and that his Enemies were neither ſo numerous nor formidable as they were by ſome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to be; That now as His Majeſty can have no cauſe to fear them, ſo they the ſaid Juſtices hope He will never be perſwaded to truſt them; That they are aſhamed that they were not likewiſe the firſt in expreſſing their Indignation againſt that moſt Execrable and Trayterous deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſſociation, lately Diſcovered by His Majeſty, which certainly in the Judgment of all good Men may more corrupt the Blood of the wicked Inventers than if they ſhould be diſcovered and attainted by Law; That the ſaid Treaſon was not only againſt the King but the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe were ſeveral other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations or Addreſſes to the King (ſome before, ſome after this of <hi>Middleſex,) viz.</hi> from <hi>Norwich,</hi> from <hi>Hereford,</hi> from the Lieutenancy of <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> All which were a Second Edition of Loyalty, or a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61366:75"/> New ſort of Addreſſes circulating from moſt parts of the Nation a Second time.</p>
            <p>The Concluſion of this Year brought forth a Remarkable paſſage in the City of <hi>London.</hi> Some unknown, but baſe and malignant hearted Raſcal, had in the Night cut, mangled, and defaced the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Picture, which with the Kings (both Nobly Painted) hung up in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> as a ſignal Ornament to the City. Soon after which Action, The Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and Court of Aldermen Publiſht in Print a Declaration, <q>In which proteſting their deep Reſentment of that inſolent and vilinous Act (to be abhorr'd by every good and Loyal Subject) and being greatly concern'd and deſirous to find out the Author thereof, they therefore unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly Publiſh and declare, That whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can diſcover the Perſon who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that Fact, the ſaid Lord Mayor and Aldermen will not only acknowledge the ſaid Diſcovery as a moſt acceptable Service to the ſaid City, but alſo pay to ſuch Diſcoverer the Sum of 500. <hi>l.</hi> upon the offenders Conviction. Dated the 27th of <hi>January, 33. Car.</hi> 2. and Signed <hi>Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff.</hi>

            <p>In return to which Act of the City, his Royal Highneſs ſent a Gentleman out of <hi>Scotland</hi> to complement the Mayor and Court of Aldermen, and thank 'em for their reſpect and Juſtice to his Cauſe.</p>

            <p>In <hi>March,</hi> His Royal Highneſs Arrived out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he Landed at <hi>Yarmouth</hi> on the 10th, where he was Treated at Dinner by the Magiſtrates with all the Ceremonies of Honour they could expreſs; and from thence attended by the High Sheriff of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and a Train of the Neighbouring Gentry to <hi>Norwich,</hi> where again he was Nobly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by the publick Magiſtrates with Banquets and Bonfires, and lay that Night at the Biſhops Houſe; the next Day about 6 in the Evening he arrived at <hi>New-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> where he was received by both their Majeſties with all the Marks of kindneſs and affection, having been met ſeveral Miles out of Town by the Noblemen and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen then attending about the Court.</p>
            <p>The next Day being the 12th of <hi>March,</hi> the King was Preſented at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> with an Addreſs of Abhorrency from the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery Company in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> of which ſort of Addreſs I made ſome mention towards the end of laſt year; yet becauſe the Aſſociation there mention'd, is more particularly dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher'd in this from <hi>Briſtol</hi> than any formaer
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61366:77"/> I have ſeen, I can not omit to obſerve, that the ſaid Loyal Artillery Company in <hi>Briſtol</hi> did by their ſaid Addreſs <q>Expreſs from the bottom of their Souls an utter Abhorrence of all Covenants, and Aſſociations whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever made againſt or without His Majeſties approbation, eſpecially that Treaſonable one ſeized, in the Cloſet of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> wherein the ſecuring the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion and the defence of His Majeſties Royal Perſon and Eſtate is made the pretence; but the ſubverſion of the Eſtabliſht Religion, and the final deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of His Majeſty and Lawful Succeſſors, is the real deſign, and this to be performed by devolving the whole power of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Crown and Scepter into the Major part of the Members of both Houſes, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing that Aſſociation (thô diſſolved) without regard to their quality or number, His Majeſties Guards, for the defence of His Royal Perſon, falſly ſtiled mercenary Forces and a terror to all the good People of the Land, His Majeſties Royal Brother to be excluded and deſtroyed if he comes into <hi>England,</hi> and all who ſhall oppoſe that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, accurſed, helliſh and unpreſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſſociation are to be purſued to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druction, thô in defence of His Majeſties
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61366:77"/> Title, concluding that they will aſſert and defend the Rights and Prerogatives of His Majeſty and Lawful Succeſſors in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Unions and Societies made to the Contrary, and that they cannot think that Man fit to be a Repreſentative in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who will not diſown ſuch Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</q> Theſe words are contain'd in that Addreſs, and by this Preſident we ſee what good Subjects abhor.</p>
            <p>Not long after this the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> ſent their Vice-Chancellor, Dr. <hi>Coga,</hi> to wait on the King at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> with a Loyal Addreſs of Abhorency; at which time alſo the ſaid Vice-Chancellor waited upon the Duke, and in the name of the ſaid Univerſity, <q>Wellcom'd him into <hi>England,</hi> acknowledging that by his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highneſs good Conduct, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scotland</hi> both in Church and State is ſettled in Peace; and therefore they could by no means doubt, but that under His Majeſty his Royal Highneſſ'<hi>s</hi> preſence would have a great Influence in effecting the ſame here in <hi>England,</hi> by which means all Great <hi>Brittain</hi> being joyn'd in one, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Rights of the Crown, may for ever flouriſh. To which his Royal Highneſs was pleas'd to Anſwer,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61366:78"/> after Thanks for their kind Expreſſions, that he was very glad of this and all other occaſions to declare that he would ever ſtand by the Church of <hi>England</hi> as now eſtabliſht, and countenance the Members of it, as having ſeen by experience that they are the beſt Supporters of the Crown, and that he would uſe his Endeavors and Intereſt for preſervation of the Kings perſon, and the Government in the State, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht by Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Several other Addreſſes alſo which were made to the King, had words in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating the Dukes return into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And when his Royal Highneſs came with His Majeſty to <hi>London;</hi> His Majeſty was on the 10th of <hi>April</hi> attended by the Lord Mayor, the Recorder, and Court of Aldermen; who having paid their Duty to the King, they went to St <hi>James</hi>'s, where they waited upon his Royal Highneſs, Congratulating his ſafe return into <hi>England,</hi> and to that his Pallace.</p>
            <p>Alſo His Royal Highneſs being Captain of the Artillery Company, was invited and Feaſted by that Company in <hi>London, Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Week.</p>

            <p>About <hi>Eaſter,</hi> certain Perſons (to the number of many Hundreds, as reported) did deſign to meet at a publick Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sermon and Dinner, pretended, for Gods wonderful Providence in delivering and protecting His Majeſties Perſon, the Proteſtant Religion, and Engliſh Liberties from the helliſh and frequent attempts of their Enemies the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and Tickets of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61366:79"/> Invitation to this purpoſe, were deliver'd abroad for a Meeting on <hi>Friday</hi> the 21ſt of <hi>April.</hi> Which Meeting was by ſpecial Order of His Majeſty in Council <hi>April</hi> the 19th Prohibited and ſuppreſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the appointing of publick Faſts and Thankſgivings is a matter of State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to His Majeſty by His Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and therefore ſuch a Thankſgiving being appointed by the Subject, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty lookt upon the ſame as an inſolent Attempt in manifeſt derogation of His Right, and of dangerous Conſequence.</p>
            <p>On the 3d of <hi>May,</hi> His Royal Highneſs left the Court at <hi>Windſor,</hi> in order to His Journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> from thence to fetch hether the Ducheſs, great with Child. He went by Sea in the <hi>Gloceſter</hi> Frigat, attended by ſeveral other Veſſels: In which Voyage the Dukes Ship ſtriking on the <hi>Lemon-ore</hi> Sands in <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Road, the Veſſel was loſt, with above 100 Men, but the Duke and ſeveral others of the greateſt Quality went off timely into a Yaut attending, and arrived ſafely in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Where a little before had been an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or Tumult of Apprentices at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> ſuppreſt by the Soldiers, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Blood. About the ſame time another
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61366:80"/> Tumult of Apprentices was begun at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> but quickly ſuppreſt.</p>
            <p>The Inſuing <hi>Eaſter Term</hi> yeilded ſeveral paſſages of publick note in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Court at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had brought his Action of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum Magnatum</hi> againſt one Mr. <hi>Craddock,</hi> a Citizen and Mercer in <hi>Peter-Noſter-Row,</hi> for ſpeaking ſome Words of the ſaid Earl, importing him to be a Traytor, which Action being laid in <hi>London,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Council ſhewing that there was no likelyhood of a fair Tryal by a <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Jury, by reaſon that the Earl was not only Free of the City, but alſo of the Skinners Company, of which Sheriff <hi>Pilkinton</hi> was Maſter, and that therefore the Jury ought to ariſe out of ſome Neighbouring County; to which the Court inclined, and gave the Earl his choice of any County of <hi>England,</hi> but the Earl replying, <q>That he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay down his Action than admit it to be Tryed in any other County, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard moſt of them had put <hi>Abhorrences</hi> upon him;</q> which poſitive reſolution of his did confirm the Lord Chief Juſtice in his Opinion of the Earls confiding in a <hi>London</hi> Jury, and therefore order'd that unleſs he would conſent to Try it by a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61366:80"/> Country Jury, it ſhould not be Tryed in <hi>London;</hi> whereupon the Earl diſcontinued his Action.</p>
            <p>The like Rule was made ſoon after in the ſame Court between the ſaid Earl and Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> Principal of <hi>Cliffords</hi> Inn, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom his Lordſhip had brought an Action of Conſpiracy, he having been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Kings Council to be Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor in the Indictment againſt the ſaid Earl at the <hi>Old-Baily.</hi> The like Rule alſo in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> in <hi>Slingsby Bethels</hi> Caſe.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Wilmore</hi> the <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Foreman of <hi>Collidges</hi> Grand Jury, having convey'd away a young Boy and ſent him to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> a Writ <hi>de Homine replegiando</hi> was brought againſt him, upon which Writ the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> making an inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Return, and obſtinately refuſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <hi>Elongatus eſt,</hi> which was the Return proper in this Caſe, they were both brought into the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> upon an Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where they received a ſevere reproof from the Court, and were glad to ſubmit, with aſſurance of better behaviour for the future. Hereupon <hi>Elongatus eſt</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, a <hi>Capias</hi> in <hi>Withernam</hi> iſſued out againſt <hi>Wilmore,</hi> to take him into Cuſtody and detain him until he produces the Boy.</p>
            <pb n="146" facs="tcp:61366:81"/>
            <p>Nor was this fufficient, but the ſaid <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> was on the 23d of <hi>May</hi> Tryed at the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Bar upon an Information ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Attorney General, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying away the ſaid Boy being under the Age of 13, and unknown to his Parents; and upon a full Evidence of the foul Fact, he was found Guilty by a <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Jury, who never went from the Bar.</p>
            <p>Really the <hi>London</hi> Jurys were at this time notorious to the whole Nation for partiality. The foreſaid <hi>Wilmore</hi> had been Indicted in the City for the ſaid Crime of Boy-ſtealing, but the Grand Jury there found the Bill <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> Alſo one <hi>Harris</hi> Tryed at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> for diſperſing a moſt wicked Libel was, againſt a moſt apparent and home Evidence, and the Poſitive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Court, found Not Guilty, for which finding the ſaid Jury could give no other reaſon than their own Arbitrary Will. For ſuch like Actions as theſe His Majeſty was pleas'd to Order the Attorney-General to bring a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt the City of <hi>London;</hi> of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>On the 27th of <hi>May,</hi> The Duke, Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs and Lady <hi>Anne</hi> arrived at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> having been met there by the King and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61366:81"/> Queen, who came from <hi>Windſor</hi> that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and were all entertain'd at Dinner that Day at my Lord <hi>Arlingtons</hi> at the end of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park. But the King return'd to <hi>Windſor</hi> that Night.</p>
            <p>The next Day the King fell ill (occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd as ſuppoſed by ſome Cold caught the Day before) of which indiſpoſition He recover'd again upon breathing a Vein, in a few Days, to the great Joy of all His Loyal Subjects.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 6th of <hi>June,</hi> Captain <hi>Ayres,</hi> the Pilot of the <hi>Gloceſter</hi> Frigate, late caſt away when the Duke Sayl'd to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was Tryed before Special Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Seamen, and being found Guilty of that grievous loſs, was Sentenced by the ſaid Commiſſioners to perpetual Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and accordingly was Committed to the <hi>Marſhalſea. Vid. Stat. 13. Car.</hi> 2 Ch. 9. <hi>Art.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>About this time it was that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles in <hi>London,</hi> began to be diſturb'd in good earneſt, and the <hi>Statute</hi> put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt them. On the 20th of <hi>June,</hi> my Lord Mayor iſſued out his Orders to the Aldermen of all the Wards, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Conſtables of every Ward to be up on <hi>Sundays,</hi> and aſſiſt thoſe who ſhould
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61366:82"/> put the ſaid <hi>Stat.</hi> in Execution againſt ſuch as ſhould reſiſt, as it ſeems, ſome had the Confidence to do the <hi>Sunday</hi> before.</p>
            <p>Againſt the 24th of <hi>June,</hi> (the Cuſtomary Day for Electing Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> for the Year inſuing) my Lord Mayor Iſſued out his Summons to the ſeveral Companies to appear at <hi>Guildhall,</hi> on the ſaid 24th Day of <hi>June,</hi> for the Confirmation of Mr. <hi>Dudly North</hi> (whom his Lordſhip had choſen for one, according to Cuſtom at the <hi>Bridge-Houſe</hi> Feaſt) and for the choice of another Sheriff. At the Day appointed a mighty Concourſe of People Aſſembled in <hi>Guildhall,</hi> before my Lord Mayor and Sheriffs fitting in the <hi>Huſtings;</hi> there were two Parties appear'd in Competition, Mr. <hi>North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Box</hi> on the one Party, and Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> on the other; but in their Polling (which was mannaged by the now Sheriffs, Mr. <hi>Pilkinton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shute</hi>) it was obſerved that their Names were refuſed to be enter'd who Polled for the Confirmation of <hi>North,</hi> and Election of <hi>Box;</hi> and on the other ſide it was ſaid that ſeveral Mens Names were enter'd who were not really preſent, or not duly intitled to Vote; whereupon my Lord Mayor Adjourn'd the Court by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61366:82"/> to 9 a Clock <hi>June</hi> 27. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the Hall, not without ſome abuſes from the diſaffected Party 30 not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which Adjournment the two Sheriffs continued to Poll on till Night. The next Day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> admitted of no buſineſs: But on <hi>Munday</hi> Morning my Lord Mayor, the Court of Aldermen, and the two Sheriffs were ſent for to appear before the King and Council, where the matter being fully examined, the two Sheriffs were ſent to the <hi>Tower:</hi> The Warrant for their Commitment being Signed by 24 Privy Counſellers.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 27th of <hi>June,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Hall was again Adjourn'd over to <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 5th of <hi>July.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 30th of <hi>June,</hi> the two Sheriffs above-mention'd were brought by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Bar, where they were admitted to be Bail'd by four Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of conſiderable Eſtate, themſelves in 2000 <hi>l.</hi> piece, and the Bail each in 1000 <hi>l.</hi> At the ſame time they pleaded Not Guilty to an Information for a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous and Riotous Aſſembly in holding the Common Hall above-mention'd after it was Adjourn'd and the Aſſembly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
            <pb n="150" facs="tcp:61366:83"/>
            <p>The Sheriffs being thus at liberty, met at the Common Hall on the 5th of <hi>July,</hi> and notwithſtanding that the Lord Mayor (being Sick) ſent order by the Recorder to Adjourn the Hall to the 7th follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, yet the Sheriffs and the multitude proceeded in the Election, and declar'd their Choice of <hi>Papillon</hi> and <hi>Dubois:</hi> On the 7th the Mayor and His Party met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at <hi>Guildhall,</hi> but ſome diſputes ariſing concerning the laſt Adjournment, four Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers were ſent for to the Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to argue the validity of the Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>George Jeffreys</hi> and Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> for the Mayor, and Mr. <hi>Polexfin</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> on the other ſide; but coming to no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, the Court was Adjourn'd further to that Day Sennight, being the 14th of <hi>July.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> The King was pleaſed to Iſſue out an Order of Council in theſe Words,</p>

            <p>This was Read the next Day in the Common Hall, but oppoſed by the adverſe Party with noiſe and Clamour, ſome cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out for the <hi>Stat. 16.

But this being thought not pertinent to this purpoſe, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; my Lord Mayor declaring in the firſt place Mr. <hi>North</hi> duly Elected by him, and that he would Pole for the other Three, <hi>viz. Box, Papillon,</hi> and <hi>Dubois</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly cauſed Books to be fitted with

The next Day being <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15th, my Lord Mayor declar'd Mr. <hi>Box</hi> duly Elected by the Majority of Voices in his Books, and therefore <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Box</hi> to be Sheriffs for next Year. On the other Hand the Now Sheriffs declar'd <hi>Papillon</hi> and <hi>Dubois</hi> to have the Majority in their Books; and ſo the Pole ended.</p>
            <p>On the 27th of <hi>July</hi> the Court of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen Aſſembled, not without ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of a Diſturbance from the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Two Companies were order'd to be up at the <hi>Exchange</hi> that Day, and the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy placed themſelves in the Gallery before the Room where the Aldermen ſate, to keep off the Rabble from preſſing in; A great number were gather'd into <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> for an Anſwer to a Petition, which they had formerly deliver'd to that Court, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that <hi>Papillon</hi> and <hi>Dubois</hi> ſhould be call'd forth to give Bond to ſerve for the two Sheriffs of next Year.

            <p>With this Anſwer, the Lord Mayor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them in the Kings name to depart; He alſo commanded Sheriff <hi>Pilkinton</hi> to go out and cauſe 'em to depart, which Mr. Sheriff could not diſobey, thô he himſelf and all that party were diſſatisfied with the Anſwer.

            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> 9th of <hi>Aug.</hi> the King, was pleaſed to ſend Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> to fetch the Privy Seal from the Earl of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> which was accordingly deliver'd up. And in the beginning of <hi>Michaelmaſs Term</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

            <p>On the 15th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>York</hi> was deliver'd at St. <hi>James</hi>'s of a Daughter, which was on the 16th day Baptized by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Charlotte-Maria.</hi> The God-father was the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Counteſſes of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and <hi>Arundel</hi> Godmothers.

            <p>During this Long Vacation, Mr. <hi>Box,</hi> who had been choſen Sheriff to ſerve with Mr. <hi>North,</hi> did think fitting to fine, rather than take upon him the Office. Hereupon the Lord Mayor at a Common Hall held the 19th of <hi>September,</hi> propoſed the Electing of an other Sheriff in his place, which thô much oppoſed by the adverſe party, crying, no <hi>North,</hi> no <hi>North,</hi> no Election, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet the Lord Mayor went on in the Election, and by the Majority of his party, <hi>Peter Rich</hi> Eſq; a Lieutenant Collonel in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and twice a Burgeſs in Parliament for that Burrough, was choſen, and ſo declar'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Mayor diſſolved the Court and returned to his Houſe.

But the next Morning my Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen waiting upon the King at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> gave a full account of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Whereupon the two Sheriffs were ſent for to the Council, ſeverely checkt, and told that they had been Guilty of a High Miſdemeaner; and in fine diſmiſt upon good Bail to Anſwer to an Information for the ſame.</p>
            <p>On the 28th of <hi>September</hi> in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mr. <hi>Dudly North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rich,</hi> were according to Cuſtom, ſworn Sheriffs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> before the Lord Mayor in the Huſtings.

            <p>The better part of the City of <hi>London</hi> both for Number and Quality, appear'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time very Loyal, and as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Good Affections, it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at a Common-Council held at <hi>Guild-Hall, May,</hi> 22. <q>That whereas Sir <hi>William Pritchard</hi> Knight, Lord Mayor of this City, was in a rude manner lately Arreſted at the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61366:92"/> Suit, or in the name of Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> and whereas it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> that the Action upon which the ſaid Arreſt was, was proſecuted at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> the Members of this Court to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the ſaid Citizens from this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true imputation, do declare that they were not privy or conſenting to the ſaid Action, or Arreſt, and do diſown and diſapprove the ſame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And not long after <hi>Broom</hi> the Coroner was by the Common-Council put out of that Office, and made uncapable of enjoying any place of preferment in the City.</p>

               </q> Which Addreſs being Graciouſly received by His Majeſty, they then Waited on His Royal Highneſs, and made their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him on the ſame occaſion.

But the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> by reaſon of his noble Birth, had the favour from the King to have the Common Judgment mitigated (thô he was againſt ſuch mitigation (as is reported) in the caſe of the late Vicount <hi>Stafford</hi>) and was on the day following, viz. <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 21th of <hi>July,</hi> Beheaded in <hi>Lincolns-Inn Fields.</hi> For which purpoſe a Scaffold was erected that Morning on that ſide of the Fields next to the Arch going into <hi>Duke</hi> Street, in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſaid Arch and the corner turning

            <p>
               <hi>Friday,</hi> the 4th of <hi>January,</hi> the Lord <hi>Peters</hi> who had lain a long time a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> on the account of <hi>Oates</hi>'s Plot, without being brought to his Tryal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this Life in his ſaid Confinement. A little before his departure the ſaid Lord ſent to the King a Letter, wherein he diſown'd in his laſt Words, and upon his Salvation,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61366:102"/> the matters which he ſtood accuſed of.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>December</hi> this Year began a very eminent and extraordinay Froſt, it laſted without any conſiderable Intermiſſion till the 5th of <hi>February,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time the <hi>Thames</hi> was Frozen over with a ſolid and Contiguous Ice in all places above the Bridge, Booths built thereon, with Thouſands of People conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually walking over, and Sliding; I my ſelf walkt over at the <hi>Temple,</hi> and ſo all along the Channel to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Stairs on the 9th of <hi>January:</hi> Alſo on or about the ſame Day Coaches went over at <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> and at the <hi>Temple.</hi> In the Extremity of this Weather, the King granted His Letters Mandatory, Dated the 4th of <hi>January,</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> to make a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all Pariſhes in <hi>London</hi> and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs of the ſame, for the relief of the Poor, encouraging His Subjects to ſuch a needful Charity by his own Example, having order'd large Sums of Mony to be Iſſued out of His Treaſury for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which Letters were Read in all Churches the two following <hi>Sundays,</hi> and Collections made accordingly. On the 23d of <hi>January,</hi> being the Firſt Day of <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> the Lawyers went over the Ice from
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61366:102"/> the <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and back again, as familiarly as on the Land, ſome walkt on Foot, and ſome went in Coaches which carried People from the <hi>Temple</hi> Stairs to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for the ſame fare as by Land, and plied between thoſe two places (though not in ſo great Numbers) as the Watermen do in Summer. Abundance of Booths were erected Croſs between the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Southwark</hi> in which place an abſolute Fair was held, for above a Fortnight, of almoſt all ſorts of Trades, and Printing Preſſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected both for Letters and Pictures; a Bull Baited, a Fox Hunted, and a whole Ox Roaſted on the Ice over againſt <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi> Nor was this Froſt thus Wonderful only above the Bridge, but Booths were erected, and People paſt over on the Ice, frequently in diverſe places, below the Bridge. And the Sea it ſelf frozen for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Miles from the Shore, on the Coaſts of <hi>England, France,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Holland;</hi> Inſomuch that for above a Fortnight no Packet Boat or any other Veſſel of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, could either come out of thoſe parts or go from hence.</p>
            <p>Thus ends this Year, a Year of Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary note in <hi>England,</hi> for the happy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a Helliſh Conſpiracy againſt the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61366:103"/> Lives of his Sacred Majeſty, and Royal Highneſs, and againſt the Antient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Kingdom both in Church and State, a Conſpiracy contrived and carried on by Proteſtant Diſſenters, inveterate <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> and old Common-wealths-men.</p>
            <p>Nor was this Year leſs remarkable abroad, partly for the Death of <hi>Anna Tereſia</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> but above all for the formidable and Bloody Deſcent of the Turks, into <hi>Hungary,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited thither by Count <hi>Tekeley,</hi> a Proteſtant Rebel againſt the Emperor. The Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Army conſiſting of 150000 fighting Men, Horſe and Foot, came before <hi>Vienna</hi> on the 9th of <hi>July,</hi> Commanded by the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi> in Perſon. The Emperor had retired two Days before, and left the City under the Command of Count <hi>Staremberg,</hi> who defended it bravely, notwithſtanding all the Bloody Aſſaults and utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of the Enemy, till on the 12 / 2 of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> the Seige was rais'd, in the highth of the Defendants Extremity, by the coming of the King of <hi>Poland;</hi> who having joyn'd with the Imperial Forces, Commanded by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> not only beat off and routed the Turkiſh Army, with vaſt Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and no leſs Booty, but purſuing his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61366:103"/> Blow, took from them the Fort of <hi>Barkan,</hi> and the City of <hi>Gran</hi> (formerly call'd <hi>Strigonium</hi>) after it had been poſſeſt by the Turks 78 Years. Which City had been formerly, before it was loſt by the Chriſtians, the Metropolitan City of <hi>Hungary.</hi> To the Glory of the Engliſh Nation, ſome of our Country Men were preſent at the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> in defence of which they Signal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd their Valour. In particular the Lord <hi>Landſdown,</hi> Eldeſt Son of the Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi> whom for his extraordinary merits the Emperor created a Count of the Sacred Empire: An Honour which the Anceſtors of the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly attain'd in the defence of <hi>Strigonium.</hi>

            <p>One thing more, renders this Year re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, which was partly Domeſtick and Partly Foraign. <hi>Tangier</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> being poſſeſt by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> came to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> with our now Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi> and having coſt our King ſince he had it, vaſt Sums of Mony in defending it againſt the Moors, and alſo in making the greateſt part of a Mole there, which not being found ſo feaſible, as expected, the Charges very great and certain, the Expectation of any advantage from thence very uncertain; His Majeſty was pleaſed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61366:104"/> about the end of this laſt Summer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion my Lord <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> attended with about 20 Sail of Ships, to go and utterly to demoliſh the ſaid Town, Caſtle, and Mole at <hi>Tangier,</hi> to choke up the Haven, and to bring off the Ordinance, and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Inhabitants to <hi>England,</hi> ſending the Foraigners to their ſeveral Countries, but firſt compounding with every Man for his Ground, Eſtate, and Property in their ſeveral Houſes; all which was accordingly done in about ſix Months time.</p>

            <p>The Principal Lords were Bound in a Recognizance of 10000 <hi>l</hi> each, and their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bail in 5000 <hi>l</hi> each, upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the abovemention'd principal Lords do appear in the Houſe of Lords the next Seſſions of Parliament, and not depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave of that Court.</p>
            <p>On the ſame Day Mr. <hi>John Hamden</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Judgment. He had been accuſed and Committed for High Treaſon in the late accurſed Conſpiracy, but in regard, there wanted the Circumſtance of Two Witneſſes againſt him, which is neceſſary in all Caſes of that nature, he was Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Tryed in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Court, this Term, and found Guilty of a High Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and Miſdemeaner in Conſpiring to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and now his Judgment was That he ſhould pay 40000 <hi>l</hi> for a Fine to the King, and find Sureties for his good Behavior during Life, and to be Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted till this be paid and done.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Trenchard,</hi> and ſome others who had been accuſed for being in the ſaid Conſpiracy, and had been ſince admitted to Bail, were on this laſt Day of <hi>Hillary-Term,</hi> abſolutely diſcharg'd.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable in relation to the late great
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61366:106"/> Froſt, That the extremity of that Weather had made ſuch a Mortality and Sickneſs (as I may call it) among Fiſh, not only of freſh Rivers and Ponds, but even at Sea, that abundance of Fiſh of almoſt all ſorts were obſerved to dye of themſelves, and float to Shore; upon which account ſeveral Phyſitians of the Roman Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having conſider'd of the eating of Fiſh, they agreed that it muſt needs be unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; whereupon a general diſpenſation was granted by the Eccleſiaſticks of that Party to all Roman Catholicks for the eating of Fleſh three Days in the Week, <hi>viz.

            <p>On the 21ſt of <hi>April, James Holloway</hi> Merchant being out-law'd in Treaſon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been Indicted for the late Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and fled, was brought to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Bar: where the Attorney-General declared to the Court, and the Court to him, That if he thought he could make himſelf appear Not Guilty, the King would wave his Attainder by Outlary, and he might ſtand a Tryal by a Jury: But he Declar'd That he could not undertake to make himſelf appear Not Guilty, for he had confeſt his Guilt to the King: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Rule of Court was made for his Execution on the 30th of the preſent <hi>April,</hi> on which Day he was accordingly Executed.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 10th of <hi>May, Titus Oates</hi> was arreſted at the <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Coffee-Houſe, in an Action of <hi>Scandalum Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> at the Suit: of His Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> for calling the ſaid Duke Traytor, and other abominable Language.

            <p>On the firſt of <hi>October</hi> was made a Review or Muſter of His Majeſties Land Forces on <hi>Putney Heath;</hi> a moſt Gallant Military ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.

And to ſhew What matters are too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently tranſacted in Conventicles, one <hi>Thomas Roſwell</hi> a Conventicle Preacher at <hi>Redriff</hi> was this Term Tryed and convicted of High Treaſon, in ſpeaking certain very foul and Treaſonable Words on the 14th of <hi>September</hi> laſt, in his Preachment at his ſaid Conventicle; but ſome queſtions ariſing in Relation to the form of his Indictment, which being argued by Council on both ſides, the Court took time to adviſe of their Judgment till next Term, and before that arrived, the ſaid <hi>Roſwell</hi> obtained His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Gracious Pardon. But as if this was not ſufficient to ſhew the ill Principles of the Diſſenting Party, about the ſame time news arrived at <hi>London,</hi> of the moſt Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berous Act in <hi>Scotland</hi> that has been heard

            <p>The Roads being this Winter extreamly infeſted with Robbers, His Majeſty was pleaſed, on the 19th of <hi>December,</hi> to Order in Council, and declare His pleaſure for redreſs, <q>That all His Officers of Juſtice and other His loving Subjects do uſe their utmoſt Diligence and Endeaver for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all Robbers and Highway Men; And for the Encouragement of ſuch as ſhall apprehend any ſuch Offender, it was further Order'd, That ſuch Perſon or Perſons, who ſhall at any time from the preſent, till the 19th of <hi>December,</hi> 1685, and after that day, till His Majeſty ſhall pleaſe to recall this Order, either by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation or His Order in Council, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend any Robber or Highway Man, and cauſe him to be brought into Cuſtody, ſhall within 15 days after his Conviction have a Reward of 10 <hi>l.</hi> for every ſuch Offender ſo apprehended and Convicted; And all Sheriffs of the Reſpective Counties where ſuch Conviction ſhall be had, are by the ſaid Order required, upon the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of the Judge, or Two or more Juſtices

            </p>
            <p>This Chriſtmaſs the reſtleſs and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit of the Diſſenters, appeared again, by diſperſing in ſeveral Places in and about <hi>London,</hi> a moſt Wicked, Falſe, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Libel, relating to the Death of the Late Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and upon ſtrict ſearch and enquiry after the Author, One <hi>Henry Danvers,</hi> Commonly call'd Colonel <hi>Danvers,</hi> late of <hi>Newington</hi> in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> appear'd
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61366:111"/> to be the man; but being upon the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, fled, His Majeſty was pleaſed on the 4th of <hi>Jan.</hi> to command publick Notice to be given, <q>That whereas the ſaid <hi>Henry Danvers</hi> ſtands accuſed upon Oath of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Treaſonable and Dangerous Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and is fled from Juſtice, Whoever ſhall apprehend the ſaid <hi>Henry,</hi> and cauſe him to be delivered into ſafe Cuſtody, that he may be proceeded againſt according to Law, ſhall receive a Reward of 100 <hi>l.</hi> to be forthwith paid by the Lords Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Treaſury.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of this <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> Sir <hi>Scroop How,</hi> one of the Knights of the Shire for the County of <hi>Nottingham</hi> in the late Parliaments, appear'd in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Court, to Anſwer to an Information for words ſpoke againſt His Majeſty and Royal Highneſs, which being Read, he pleaded Guilty, confeſt his offence with much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and caſt himſelf upon the King'<hi>s</hi> and Duke'<hi>s</hi> mercy: To whom being the next Day introduc'd, he was upon his humble Submiſſion, received to Grace; upon which he acknowledg'd, that he owed to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Goodneſs his Life, and his Eſtate; and that he would for the future dedicate
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61366:112"/> both to the Service of His Majeſty, and the Royal Family.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the 36th Year of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Reign, in a State of Tranquillity and Peace, after ſo many Terrors, Diſquiets and Tumults; the Remembrance of which, as it Magnifies our preſent Happineſs by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of paſt Troubles, ſo ought we never to forget to pay our due Applauſe, Love, and Veneration to the Sacred Memory of our late Gracious Soveraign King <hi>Charles the</hi> 2d, who (under God) has wrought this Bleſſed Change: A Change by which He render'd His Subjects the moſt happy People of <hi>Europe,</hi> and himſelf the moſt Glorious and Admired Prince of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> who by a Conduct truly Royal, could reduce a People Plunged, and almoſt overwhelm'd in Confuſion, into a Quiet not to be expected, hardly to be hoped for; and by his incomparable Prudence aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage a Faction blown up into a Tempeſt, more Violent &amp; Deaf than Winds, and Seas. In what Words, what Deeds, can we expreſs a Gratitude equal to ſuch a Merit? Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Marble, and Tryumphal Arches may pay a leſſer Debt of Veneration; but for this Bleſſing, ſuch are too poor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. Let all True <hi>Engliſhmen</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:61366:112"/> raiſe him a Better, a more laſting, and more Worthy Monument, a Monument of Grateful Hearts: Let us Eternize His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Name through all Generations; Let our Applauſes laſt for ever: But above all, let us expreſs our Love and Eſteem for His Memory, by our unfained Loyalty, true Faith, and Allegiance to His moſt Royal, and moſt Equal Brother, the Brother of His Vertues, Our preſent Gratious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign <hi>King</hi> JAMES <hi>the Second;</hi> whom God grant long to Live and Reign over us, to the unſpeakable Joy and Comfort of all His Majeſties Good Subjects, and to the Confuſion of His Enemies.</p>
            <p>☞ Note, that the year of our Lord in the running Title is to be ſuppoſed to begin according to the Almanack, in <hi>January,</hi> and not on the 25th of <hi>March.</hi>
